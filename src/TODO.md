- [ ] Implement dynamic padding (global padding to longest causes memory issue)
- [ ] Split the computations to more GPUs
- [x] Implement early stopping (instead of fixed amount of epochs)
- [x] Check if the adapter works properly in chat.py (missing keys error) | it works, the error just went away
- [ ] Refactor to enable hyperparam tuning
- [ ] Quantization issue
- [ ] Gradient checkppointing? (should help with memory issue)
- [x] Add warmup
- [x] Check if the apply_chat_template makes any difference | yes, it does
- [ ] Add system message ("role": "system") about its context (you are ISbot) - some question may be answered generally without right contexts
