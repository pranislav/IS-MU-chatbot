- [ ] Implement dynamic padding (global padding to longest causes memory issue)
- [ ] Split the computations to more GPUs
- [ ] Implement early stopping (instead of fixed amount of epochs)
- [ ] Check if the adapter works properly in chat.py (missing keys error)
- [ ] Refactor to enable hyperparam tuning
- [ ] Quantization issue
- [ ] Gradient checkppointing? (should help with memory issue)
- [ ] Add warmup
- [ ] Check if the apply_chat_template makes any difference
