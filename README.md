# IS MU Chatbot: AI-Powered Assistance for Masaryk University IS

## Project Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a language model to assist users in navigating the Information System of Masaryk University (IS MU). The goal is to enhance the model with IS-specific knowledge, making it easier for users to get help with IS-related tasks without having to search through extensive Help pages.

## Motivation
The IS MU is known to be complex and challenging to use, especially for beginners. Large language models, while powerful, cannot effectively assist users because they lack access to IS-specific information. This project seeks to bridge that gap by fine-tuning a language model with IS-related content, providing a more user-friendly and accessible solution for navigating the system.

## Data Sources
The training data for this project will primarily come from the official IS MU Help pages. Additionally, we will expand the dataset using a larger language model to generate more comprehensive responses.

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of the [**PA026 Artificial Intelligence Project**](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2025/PA026) course at Masaryk University.
