							Beginning with the autumn 2016 semester, the course opinion poll 
consists of 6 questions. Since autumn 2023 one new question was added, 
since autumn 2024 one question was deleted, i.e. still a total of 6 
questions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first question focuses on the course as a coherent unit 
within a given semester, i.e. including any seminar groups taking place 
within the framework of such a course. Only one answer is thus required,
 regardless of how many teachers are actually associated with such a 
course. Answer to this question is saved for the entire course (i.e. all
 course–teacher and seminar group–tutor combinations) regardless of 
which course teacher or tutor the question was answered for.
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>The course is of educational value to me; it enriches me.</strong>
 – The question requires students to provide an answer on a scale from 
"strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" with a given statement; if 
necessary, students may provide "no answer".</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							Four additional questions are associated with a particular course
 teacher or seminar group tutor. These questions are answered 
individually for each teacher. Answers indicate student opinion of each 
statement, expressed on a scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly 
disagree"; if necessary, students may provide "no answer".
						</p>

						<ol start="2">
							<li><strong>The teacher’s presentation of the subject matter was always clearly intelligible.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher was always well prepared for class.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher provided clear information regarding the knowledge and skills that will be evaluated.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher always communicated with and treated students with respect.</strong></li>
						</ol>

						<p>The final question is associated with a particular course 
teacher or seminar group tutor. This question is optional. Students may 
provide the teacher with comprehensive feedback, including critical 
comments as well as a positive evaluation of his/her work.
						</p>

						<ol start="6">
							<li><strong>In your opinion, what does the teacher excel in? What
 do you value most in their course or in their approach to teaching? Do 
you have any recommendations regarding the teacher's lessons or approach
 to teaching?</strong> – The

							Questions 1 to 5 required students to provide an answer on a 
scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" with a given 
statement; if necessary, students were also given the option to provide 
"no answer". These answers are displayed in an interactive graph with 
response rates.
						</p>
						<p>
							The interactive graph allows users to click on an item in order 
to hide/show the proportion of a selected category in the graph. Placing
 your cursor on individual response categories will display a 
percentage; pointing to the question itself will display the full 
question text (hidden in the case of small screens).
						</p>
						<p>
							Columns next to the graph indicate the number of students who 
provided answers to a question relevant to a specific course (question 
1) or teacher (questions 2 to 5), mean course and teacher score at a 
given faculty and mean selected course and teacher score.
						</p>
						<p>
							All written comments by means of which the students were enabled 
to elaborate their replies are only displayed to the relevant teachers 
and their superiors (for example course supervisor has the right to read
 written comments related to
							course teachers; course lecturer has the right for comments 
related to seminar tutors and other lecturers as well). The MU Faculty 
of Social Studies is the only exception to this rule; the faculty has 
decided to display all written
							responses anonymously to teachers and students alike.
