</li><li><strong>Study planner</strong> – allows you to choose courses from a pre-created study plan.
</li><li><strong>Unsuccessful courses</strong> – the possibility of 
choosing courses that you have not successfully completed and are listed
 in the given semester. According to the SZŘ, you must re-enroll in 
unsuccessful courses as soon as possible. If you do not add them with 
this option, the system will add them automatically at the beginning of

 registered before registration begins.
</li><li><strong>Courses for everyone</strong> – a faculty offer directly addressed to students
of other faculties and programmes (courses have no enrolment
restrictions and do not require in-depth knowledge of the field).
</li><li><strong>Courses enrolled in most often</strong> – the offer of courses most enrolled by
students of the same programme.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><ul><li>An unsuccesfully completed course that is not offered every 
semester is registered for before registration begins (this gives you 
the best ranking).
</li><li>An unsuccesfully completed course that is offered every 
semester is not forced on you before registration begins because grades 
have not
yet been awarded (all students in the course appear to be repeating for 
failure). You will be automatically registered and enrolled before
the start of the enrolment period (you will be ahead of regular
students in the rankings). If you know you will be repeating a course, 
however, we recommend that you register for it as soon as possible.
</li><li>If you receive a grade by the end of the change in enrollment 
(the reason for repeating the course will pass) or if the Office for
Studies approves your request not to repeat, the IS will automatically 
cancel the course from your enrollment.
</li><li>If a course is set to "it is possible to enrol in the course
repeatedly" then it will not be automatically canceled from the course 
enrollment, even after a passing grade has been received for the past 
semester.
</li><li>A course will not be forced on you if a course with the same 
code is allowed to be not repeated at any later time after a failing 
grade.
</li><li>A forced course will automatically enroll the day before the start of the enrollment period even if it is registered in red.</li></ul>
<p>

Forcing courses is not done in these cases:
</p><ul><li>PE compulsory courses – instead of the uncompleted sport you can choose another, you have to register separately.

</li><li>Interrupted studies – if you intend to register for a course, 
register for the courses separately and have your studies resumed as 
soon as possible by the office for studies due to the order in the 
capacity-limited courses.
</li><li>Study with an individual study plan – unsuccessful courses may 
be registered by the office for studies after enrollment changes period

satisfactory ranking will be automatically enrolled. The current rank
is listed in the "Position" column. The system uses the following
rules to determine the rank order:
<p>
</p><ol><li>All those who have already enrolled in the course are ranked
 first
(the Office for Studies may enrol the course regardless of the order). 
They have a ranking of 0. Their number can be found in the "Numbers".

</li><li>Students who have to repeat the course are ranked second. For most
courses, these students are automatically registered by the system
before registration begins (they are in good position), and for
courses offered each semester, before the enrolment period begins.
Their current number (i.e. those who do not yet have a passing grade)
can be found in the "Repeating" section. The number of repeaters
includes students who have registered for a course with a bad time
stamp; this grade will automatically improve during the night.

</li><li>In addition, priority is given to students who are actively
studying one of the "the fields the course is directly associated
with". You can find out if you have priority in the "Preference"
section. To find out how many applicants do and do not have priority, see the "Numbers" section.
</li><li>Last in the list are those students who are not studying the 
fields the course is directly associated with and are not repeating the 
course.</li></ol>
<p>
Inactive (e.g. interrupted) studies and studies with already awarded 
grades (e.g. recognised courses) are not included in the calculation.
</p><p>
Within these groups, the order is according to the time stamp assigned 
at registration. You can find your stamps under the "More information" 
link. If more than one record has the same timestamp, they are further
sorted according to the record's internal identification in the
system. For example, the time stamp is followed by 16/25, which means 
that it is the 16th of 25 time stamps created in that second.
</p><p>
If a student registers for the same course in more than one of his/her 
studies, the system will search for the course and change the time
stamp to the best stamp found in all the registrations of that
student. The change will not take effect until 24 hours following the 
registration of the course.
</p><p>
<strong>How can the achieved ranking change?</strong>
</p><ul><li>If the fields the course is directly associated with in the
catalogue change, a different number of students will be given
priority.
</li><li>Repeat students will appear in the ranking (before the 
enrollment period begins) and will be automatically registered by the 
system.
</li><li>Students with previously interrupted studies who were able to
register but whose ranking has not yet entered the calculation will be registered.
</li><li>The office for studies will enrol a certain number of students
outside the normal registration.
</li><li>A reduction in rank may occur if someone placed ahead of you
unregisters because they no longer need to repeat the course or
finished (interrupts) their studies. This change can also occur if a
student ahead of you had the course recognized (students with a
recognized course are not counted towards the course capacity).</li></ul>

actively studying more than one field of study). For one semester, 30 
credits are counted towards the minimum credit value of studies.
<p>
The distinction between compulsory and optional courses is not yet
implemented in the system. Therefore, it is possible to submit a
request for cancellation of the obligation to repeat even for courses
that are compulsory for you. You have to distinguish yourself whether
the course is compulsory or optional. The office for studies will
refuse the request to cancel a compulsory course, but you will be
adding unnecessary work to the office for studies. The operators of
the system apologise for not yet implementing this feature in
is.muni.cz.

 messages in the table of registered courses indicate problems and these
 courses will not be enrolled for you. Courses may be registered as 
problematic (red) for a variety of reasons.
If the reason is an unmet prerequisite (i.e., if a student has a good 
time stamp but has not met the prerequisite), then that student is 
blocking space in the course for other students with a problem-free 
registration but a worse time stamp.
If a student with a red registration meets the prerequisite at the time 
of course enrolment, the course will be enrolled with his/her time 
grade.
For some reasons, a teacher may be asked to grant an exception/consent 
to enroll via the "Apply for permission" link found in the "Registered 
courses" section for each course.

</p><p>
This link is available during the course enrollment period and the
enrollment change period. It is not available during the course
registration period. During this period, a number of registration
issues are resolved (missing prerequisites, etc.), so requests for
exceptions do not need to be submitted yet.
</p><p>
The application will offer a form for the text of the letter to the 
teachers of the course. Include in the letter the reasons why the 
teacher should grant you an exception or permission to enroll. To submit
 the request, click the "Apply for permission and send email" button.
You can withdraw the pending request again at the same
location. The application will send an email to the teacher (or course 
guarantor or contact person, depending on who is responsible for 
handling exceptions).
If the change is such that your original red registration is white (the 
problem has been resolved), the teacher sees that it is unnecessary to 
consider the exception request. You can withdraw the application if you 
wish, but it is not necessary.
</p><p>
Submit your request for an exception in time for the teacher to
respond by the end of the enrollment change period. Otherwise, you
will not be enrolled in the course.
If the teacher clicks to grant the exception in the MU IS, the course will be automatically enrolled immediately.
</p><p>
In some cases, an exemption cannot be requested because the teacher may 
not grant it. In these cases, only the office for studies can register 
the course.</p></div></li><li data-accordion-item="" id="s_reg_prerekvizity" class="accordion-item  "><a class="accordion-title app-heading app-heading-ready" href="#" aria-controls="1sevut-accordion" role="tab" id="s_reg_prerekvizity" aria-expanded="false" aria-selected="false"><span class="cislo_otazky">12.</span>What are prerequisites and how are they evaluated?<a href="#s_reg_prerekvizity" class="isi-link-h30 app-heading-ico"></a></a><div data-tab-content="" class="accordion-content " role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="s_reg_prerekvizity" aria-hidden="true" id="1sevut-accordion">Pre-requisites represent the requirements which the student must meet to be allowed to enroll in a course.

<strong>Checking pre-requisites in the process of granting enrollment permissions/exceptions</strong>
</p><p>
If an "error in the prerequisite" message is displayed when evaluating
prerequisites, information about the last component of the
prerequisite being evaluated is listed. The pre-requisite is evaluated 
only until a clear result is known. So, for example, if a prerequisite 
is entered as IB000 &amp;&amp; "whatever" and the student has not 
completed IB000, then "whatever" is no longer even evaluated and IB000 
is listed as an error. If the prerequisite is given as IB000 || 
"anything" and the student has not completed IB000, then "anything" is 
printed as a possible error.
</p><p>

<br>
The student has not met IB000, it is evaluated whether he/she has met at
 least IB112 (because it is IB000 || IB112). If he/she has not met 
either IB000 or IB112, then the prerequisite is evaluated as 0 
&amp;&amp; "whatever" and thus does not need to be evaluated further. 
The last expression evaluated was IB112, which is also listed as an 
error.
If a student meets the prerequisites to enroll in a course in one
study and has the course registered or enrolled there without
problems, then he/she automatically meets the prerequisites in all
his/her other studies.</p></div>

 waves determine the order in which course registration begins for a 
particular group of students. Registration waves begin on a <strong>weekday</strong>
 only.
The start of registration for individual students is staggered over five
 waves, with progressively more students allowed to register.
<p>
The so-called residual credit volume, defined as follows, is used to determine the order:
</p><p>
The residual volume of credits for a programme is the difference
between the minimum credit value of the programme (standard study
period in semesters times 30) and the number of credits that the
student has earned so far in the programme and has to count towards the 
programme, including credits for recognised courses (if the result is 
negative, it is considered zero).
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt><strong>The first registration wave</strong>
</dt><dd>From the moment registration at a given faculty begins in a 
given semester, students are registered for studies in which they have 
achieved a residual credit volume of less than 61 credits and all 
students in doctoral degree programmes.
</dd><dt><strong>The second registration wave</strong>
</dt><dd>Additionally, students with a residual credit volume of less 
than 121 credits are allowed to start registering for courses as of two 
weekdays after registration opens.
</dd><dt><strong>The third registration wave</strong>
</dt><dd>Additionally, students with a residual credit volume of less 
than 181 credits are allowed to start registering for courses as of four
 weekdays after registration opens.
</dd><dt><strong>The fourth registration wave</strong>
</dt><dd>Additionally, students with a residual credit volume of less 
than 241 credits are allowed to start registering for courses as of six 
weekdays after registration opens.
</dd><dt><strong>The fifth registration wave</strong>
</dt><dd>From the moment eight weekdays after the opening of registration (fifth wave), all students are allowed to start registering for
courses.</dd></dl>
<p>
If a student is studying concurrently in more than one programme
(study), the remaining credit volume for each study is assessed
separately, as the student also registers for each of his/her studies separately.
</p><p>
By default, the number of credits earned is calculated at night.
However, if a student has been assigned a grade just before the start of
 a registration wave and needs credits from that grade to be
admitted to that registration wave, he/she can use the credit
recalculation application.

<p>
If your registered/enrolled courses are not showing up, please check

If you are (or have been) studying multiple studies, check that you have
 the correct study selected in the page header. This problem can occur 
when you transfer to another study – if your courses are not recognised 
and transferred to another study, they remain in the original study.

 you plan to re-enroll in your studies in the upcoming semester, 
register for courses.
Your registration requirements will not be included in the calculation 
of course registration order.
If you re-enroll in your studies at a later date, the correct rank will 
be calculated after the fact (the time stamps from when the course was 
registered will be applied).
If ranking is important to you (for capacity-constrained courses), it is
 advisable to re-enroll in your studies early, before course 
registration opens.
Otherwise, you may be overtaken in the queue (course registration) by 
students with active studies.
