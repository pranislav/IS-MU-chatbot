 The academic year has a duration of twelve months divided into an 
autumn and a spring semester, beginning on 1 September and 1 February 
respectively. Each semester includes at least one week designated for 
enrolment in the semester, no less than three weeks for course 
enrolment, no less than twelve and no more than fifteen weeks of 
teaching time and at least six weeks of examination period, so that:</p>
	<ol type="a"><li>the examination period does not overlap with teaching 
while ending at least one day prior to the last day of the period 
designated for enrolment in the next semester,
	</li><li>the period designated for enrolment in the semester ends no 
later than on the fifth working day following the first day of teaching 
in that semester,
	</li><li>the course enrolment period ends on the thirteenth calendar 
day following the first day of teaching in that semester with the 
possible exception of intensive and/or specially scheduled courses; 
enrolment regulations for such courses are specified by the dean in the 
public section of the relevant website,
	</li><li>the course registration period precedes the course enrolment period.</li></ol>

<p>The remainder of the semester constitutes vacation time.</p>



  <div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 term “course enrolment” differs from “enrolment in a semester”. The 
terms “enrolment in studies” and “re-enrolment in studies” also have a 
different meaning.</p>

<p><strong>Enrolment in studies</strong> – the faculty sends an invitation to enrolment by email or inserts it directly to the e-application.</p>
<p><strong>Enrolment in</strong> the next <strong>semester</strong> is 
made during a defined period electronically via an application in the IS
 MU. Applications for enrolment in the next semester may be submitted 
and confirmed even after the classes in the given semester have started.
If the student has two or more concurrent studies, enrolment is made for
 each of the studies separately. By submitting an application for 
enrolment in the next semester, the student expresses their will to 
continue in the studies.</p>
<p><strong>Examination period</strong> is a period of time to which 
examiners schedule the dates of course completion. It must not happen 
that no completion date of a particular course is scheduled during the 
exam period. The beginning and end of the exam period are clearly 
determined by the academic year schedule, in accordance with the 
provision of Section 3(1)(a). The possibility of completing a course 
outside the exam period is not excluded, depends, however, on the 
examiner. The examiner may schedule the course completion dates before 
the beginning as well as after the end of the exam period in accordance 
with Section 16; however, they are not obliged to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Course enrolment</strong> – within a defined period (the 
period of course registration and course enrolment – see Section 11), 
the student electronically (via an IS MU application) applies for 
courses they have chosen to study in the next semester. This is course 
registration. The IS MU checks whether the requirements for enrolment in
 the respective courses have been met and, after potential shortcomings 
are corrected, automatically confirms the student’s enrolment in such 
courses.</p>

<p>When the student attempts to register a course, problems may arise 
that could prevent course enrolment (e.g. requirements not met, capacity
 exceeded, enrolment in a course not permitted for the given studies 
etc.). Details about such issues can be displayed by clicking “Detailed 
information” in the relevant IS MU application. During the period for 
enrolment, the student is allowed to file a request for exemption (which
 must include a reasoning). In case the teacher (the guarantor or 
another person in charge) approves the exemption, the obstacle 
preventing enrolment in the course is automatically removed.</p>

<p>If the student has two or more concurrent studies, course enrolment is made separately for each of the studies. 
Applications for course enrolment may be submitted and confirmed even after the classes in the given semester have started.</p>

<p>The student is allowed to make changes to their application for 
course enrolment, i.e. cancel the registration of a course, during the 
period for course enrolment.</p><p></p></div></div>


<p>(2)	Schedules containing the timing of the academic year and the 
definition of semester periods for course registration (Section 11) are 
determined by the Rector after a discussion with the deans in such a way
 that the teaching in the semester starts at all the faculties on the 
same date, enrolment in the semester starts on the same date, the 
examination period takes place simultaneously at all faculties for a 
duration of no less than three weeks, and the period for state 
examinations (Sections 22 to 24) does not overlap for individual 
semesters.</p>
<p>(3) Weekly timetables are announced by the faculties prior to the 
first day of the course enrolment period in a given semester. Timetables
 of intensive courses and specially scheduled courses are announced by 
the faculties no less than one week prior to the beginning of such 
courses.</p>
<p>(4)	The weekly timetables are determined by the faculty in such a way
 that the courses which constitute a study template do not overlap more 
than absolutely necessary.</p></div></li><li class="accordion-item  " data-accordion-item="" id="szr_4"><a href="#" class="accordion-title app-heading app-heading-ready" aria-controls="wwnyye-accordion" role="tab" id="szr_4" aria-expanded="false" aria-selected="false"><span class="cislo_otazky">4.</span>Section 4 – Academic Year Schedule and Course Catalogue<a href="#szr_4" class="isi-link-h30 app-heading-ico"></a></a><div class="accordion-content " data-tab-content="" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="szr_4" aria-hidden="true" id="wwnyye-accordion"><p>(1)	No later than by 31 May, the faculties publish in the IS MU for the next academic year:</p>

Studies in a programme approved by the MU Internal Evaluation Board or

 implemented on the basis of a study plan.</p>
<p>(2)	Studies in a programme are implemented as full-time, distance or 
the combination of both (hereinafter referred to as the “combined

<p>(3)	A study plan is a set of compulsory courses, selective courses 
and elective courses, which are arranged in temporal and content-related
 succession so that the study objectives and the graduate’s profile of 
the programme can be achieved within the standard duration of study.</p>
<p>(4)	The studies may be:</p>
	<ol><li>single-subject, leading to the acquisition of knowledge and 
skills of the relevant programme and their deepening according to the 
choice of courses from the range of the study plan;
	</li><li>with a specialization on the basis of a specialized study 
plan, leading to the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the relevant
 programme and their deepening according to the choice of the defined 
specialty group of courses;
	</li><li>major/minor studies on the basis of a major/minor study plan, 
leading to the acquisition of knowledge and skills in the relevant 
programme and their expansion according to the minor study plan;
	</li><li>in accordance with two major study plans, leading to the 
acquisition of knowledge and skills in the relevant programme and their 
expansion according to the second major study plan.</li></ol>
	<p>(5) During the course of studies, a student may request a 
modification to the study plan governing the programme in which they are
 enrolled.</p>
	<p>(6) The faculty shall publish conditions for a modification of the 
study plan under subsection 5, which may be based mainly on the 
applicant’s knowledge, academic performance or compatibility of the 
study plans; the conditionals also contain a deadline for submitting 
applications under subsection 5.</p>
	<p>(7) An application under subsection 5 cannot be granted if the 
student, at the time the application is considered, does not meet the 
conditions for enrolment in the next semester (Section 12) or in the 
case of a programme which consists of one plan only.</p></div></li></ul></div>

 The fulfilment of study requirements in a programme (hereinafter 
referred to as “studies”) is recorded by means of a credit system based 
on the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).</p>
<p>(2) The basic unit of studies is a course identified by a unique 
course code. The amount of requirements necessary to complete a course 
is expressed by the number of credits assigned to that course 
(hereinafter referred to as the “credit value”).</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>Each
 course taught at MU faculties has a unique identification code. 
Although the contents of certain courses may be very similar, in 
academic records they are considered to be different courses.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(3) The credit value of a course, group of courses or stage of 
studies is determined in accordance with ECTS principles so that it 
corresponds to a standard workload of an average student; it is used for
 a course regardless of a programme or study mode.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>1 ECTS = 25–30 study hours.</p>
<p>60 ECTS represents a workload necessary for one year of full-time studies (30 ECTS per semester).</p>
<p>A course with a particular code can be prescribed for students of 
different degree programmes implemented at different faculties. However,
 its credit value cannot vary according to a programme the student 
pursues (the only way credit value may vary is determined by different 
manners of course completion, if admissible).</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(4) A condition for the completion of studies in a programme or field
 of study is the acquisition of credits awarded for completing courses 
prescribed by the study plan, reaching at least the minimum credit 
value, i.e. thirty times the standard duration of study in a programme 
expressed in the number of semesters.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 composition of a set of courses necessary for due completion of studies
 is prescribed by the degree programme and forms a part of accreditation
 documents. Students will find the information in study templates for 
the course of studies in the IS MU. The standard duration of study of 
some programmes in the combined mode is longer than that of programmes 
in the full-time mode, even though the programmes may have the same or 
similar contents. The minimum credit value of such programmes is 
identical and equals the minimum credit value of the full-time programme
 or, as the case may be, the minimum credit value calculated using the 
shortest standard duration set by law for the relevant programme type. 
For example, a master’s degree programme in the combined mode was 
accredited as three-year and in the full-time mode as two-year; the 
minimum credit value of either is 120.</p><p></p></div></div>


<p>(5) For the purpose of assessing the minimum credit value of studies, the following credits are recognized:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>credits gained for courses completed during the studies,
	</li><li>credits recognized in accordance with Section 14,
	</li><li>credits automatically recorded in accordance with Section 14(10),

57(1)(f) of the Act is issued separately for each of the successfully 
completed studies). If the studies were not successfully completed, the 
courses enrolled and completed, courses recognized, automatically 
recorded or transferred are listed in the transcript of records, which 
is issued by the Office for Studies together with the certificate of 
study pursuant to Section 57(5) of the Act.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(6) Credits gained for courses identical or substantially overlapping
 with courses for which the student has already gained credits in these 
studies shall not be recognized and included in the credit value.</p>

 teaching in the full-time study mode is primarily carried out face to 
face; in justified cases specified by MU methodology, it may be replaced
 by synchronous online teaching. Studies in the full time mode may also 
include asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study. The use of remote
 teaching activities in the full-time study mode is regulated by Section
 22 of MU Directive No. 1/2024.</p>
<p>The teaching in the distance study mode is delivered mainly through 
asynchronous methods, i.e. guided self-study. Distance study mode may 
also include direct teaching delivered face to face or through 
synchronous online methods. The scope and proportion of asynchronous and
 direct teaching and the method of communication with the teacher, as 
well as between the students themselves, is defined during the process 
of degree programme accreditation.</p>
<p>The teaching in the combined study mode is delivered through the 
combination of direct and asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study.
 The proportion of face-to-face teaching and synchronous online teaching
 is defined during the process of degree programme accreditation. 
Bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes in the combined study mode 
include at least 80 lessons of direct teaching per semester, except for 
the last semester of studies, in which focus is on writing the final 
thesis if mandatory in the degree programme.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(3)	Full-time students are required to participate in the instruction
 with the exception of lectures and consultations. Participation in 
other forms of instruction may be substituted with other requirements if
 so stipulated in the course specification. The obligation of students 
in the combined study mode to be present in the classes is determined in
 the course specification.</p>
<p>(4)	Classes during a semester are organized according to weekly timetables or within the framework of intensive courses.</p>
<p>(5)	The methods of assessment, manner of course completion and other 
information on the requirements for the course completion are announced

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>Depending
 on the programme, the student may be obliged in the first semesters of 
studies to enrol in certain courses in accordance with the recommended 
study plan. Enrolment in a course is only valid if confirmed by the 
relevant IS MU application. Course enrolment is automatically confirmed 
on a daily basis, however, at the latest on the first day after the end 
of the period for enrolment as determined by the academic year schedule.
The semester schedule sets the period for registration, period for 
enrolment and period for changing enrolment in courses. The student is 
allowed to choose (register) and cancel (deregister) courses during all 
the three periods. When choosing the courses, the student will search 
for course codes or use the offer in the template. Any course scheduled 
for the given semester at any MU faculty may be registered. Course 
registration takes place at different times at various faculties, 
according to the faculty semester schedule. In case the student meets 
the conditions described in the Course Catalogue, the course 
registration will be smooth (marked in white), in the opposite case, it 
will be marked in red. During the period of enrolment and enrolment 
changes, problem-free courses are confirmed, i.e. the student is 
enrolled, each night (all changes typically take place before the start 
of the semester and in the first two weeks of the semester). By 
enrolment in a course, the student becomes entitled and obliged to study
 that course.</p>
<p>The IS MU will enrol (confirm) courses only for active studies (e.g. 
those that have not been interrupted). The student may, however, 
register courses also if the studies have been interrupted. The Office 
for Studies may both register and enrol courses regardless of whether 
the studies are active or not.</p>
<p>The student may choose (register/enrol) only courses scheduled for 
the period of the academic year to which the student registers/enrols. 
The student may not register/enrol a course to the spring semester if 
such a course is only taught in autumn semesters.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(3)	A student is entitled to register and enrol in courses whose 
credit value does not exceed 60 credits in one semester for each of the 
student’s studies.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 registration of courses for a given semester in the IS MU is an 
expression of the student’s wish to take and complete the courses in the
 given semester. Early registration allows the student to be guaranteed a
 “place” in courses that are limited in capacity and can be expected to 
be in high demand. Information about the number of students who will be 
completing courses in the examination period of a given semester or 
attending classes during the semester is displayed to the teacher in the
 IS MU Teacher’s Notebook. After the registration, timetables of classes
 are prepared. The student may apply for enrolment in courses in the 
period for enrolment. In case the capacity of the course has been 
exceeded, the student cannot take the course in the given semester.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(4)	For the purpose of preparing the timetable or an offer of 
courses, the dean is entitled to decide on the obligation to register a 
course before the period for course registration and enrolment; this 
does not apply to registration immediately following enrolment or 
re-enrolment in studies.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>In
 the event that not enough students have registered a course, it may 
happen that the course will not be taught. The registration duty does 
not apply to students who enrol in courses in the first semester of 
their studies and students who enrol in courses immediately after 
re-enrolment in studies following an interruption.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(5)	The dean is entitled to limit the number of students enrolled in a
 course. In such case, the guidelines for prioritization of students are
 set, giving preference to students for whom the course is compulsory, 
selective or repeated (Section 20) and those who have registered the 
course.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 starting date of course registration for a certain group of students is
 defined by so-called registration waves. Registration waves only start 
on working days. The beginning of the registration is distributed into 
five waves, in which growing numbers of students may register.
The “remaining credit volume” is used to determine the order in which 
individual groups of students may register. This is the number of 
credits the student has to gain to reach the total required for the 
completion of their studies within a programme. The remaining credit 
volume is the difference between the minimum credit value of the studies
 (i.e. the standard duration of study in semesters multiplied by 30) and
 the number of credits gained so far that have been included in the 
total of the programme studied, including credits for recognized courses
 (if the result is negative, it is treated as zero).</p>
<p>The first registration wave: from the moment of the beginning of 
registration at a given faculty, those students whose remaining credit 
volume is lower than 61, plus all doctoral students are allowed to 
register.</p>
<p>The second registration wave: from the moment following two working 
days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose 
remaining credit volume is lower than 121 are also allowed to register.</p>    

<p>The third registration wave: from the moment following four working 
days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose 
remaining credit volume is lower than 181 are also allowed to register.</p>
<p>The fourth registration wave: from the moment following six working 
days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose 
remaining credit volume is lower than 241 are also allowed to register.</p>
<p>The fifth registration wave: from the moment following eight working 
days after the beginning of the registration, all students will 
register.</p>
<p>In case a student is enrolled in concurrent studies, the remaining 
credit volume is calculated separately for each of the studies; the 
student also registers courses separately in each of the studies.</p>
<p>The numbers of credits gained are usually calculated at night. 
However, if the student was given assessment immediately before the 
start of a registration wave and they need the credits to be admitted to
 the registration wave, the student may use the application for 
recalculating the credits.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(6)	Further conditions for enrolment in registered courses including 
the requirement of prior completion of other courses may be determined 
in the programme specification or the Course Catalogue, as the case may 
be.</p>
<p>(7)	Changes in course enrolment are only possible during the period 
designated for course enrolment and its change; this does not apply to 
enrolment in intensive or specially scheduled courses; special 
guidelines for such courses are set by the dean.</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>This right only arises when enrolment in the next semester is confirmed (Section 12).</p>
<p>The rules on which course enrolment depends are called prerequisites.
 They define study obligations to be fulfilled for the student to be 
enrolled in a course. The student cannot enrol in a course unless these 
prerequisites have been met. If the student meets the prerequisites for 
enrolment in a course in one study and has the course registered or 
enrolled without any problems, they automatically meet the prerequisites
 in all their other studies. A typical prerequisite is the successful 
completion of a course whose content is necessary for mastering the 
course to be registered. Other prerequisites include the obligation of 
simultaneous enrolment in certain courses (for example, the prohibition 
of enrolment in a course taught in the form of lectures and completed by
 examination without simultaneous enrolment in a corresponding course 
taught in the form of seminars and completed by fulfilling the 
requirements); prohibition of enrolment in a course if a course of the 
same content has already been completed or recognized, prohibition of 
simultaneous enrolment in courses of the same content; prohibition of 
enrolment in a course if a prescribed number of credits has not been 
achieved, etc. Where a prerequisite “approval” is present, an explicit 
approval by the teacher is required (through granting an exemption).</p>
<p>A prerequisite concerning university-wide PE courses is a prohibition
 to enrol in PE courses by students in bachelor’s and master's 
programmes who have already successfully completed two semester-long PE 
courses (students of the mentioned programmes are entitled to take two 
semesters of PE, students of follow-up master’s programmes are not 
entitled to enrol in PE courses); two PE courses cannot be taken 
concurrently.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(8)	Prior to the beginning of the registration period, the dean is 
entitled to determine a minimum number of students enrolled in a course;
 in case such number is not enrolled in the course, the dean is entitled
 to cancel the teaching in the course unless the course is compulsory

 studies with the need for time to stabilise the condition or cases of 
periodic recurrences and relapses (not serious in individual cases, but 
in aggregate warranting consideration as serious reasons). The decision 
to interrupt the studies for serious or ordinary reasons has a major 
impact on the calculation of the duration of studies; it is therefore

by the remainder of the semester when the request was filed. If the 
period of interruption cannot be set so as not to exceed the standard 
duration of study and at the same time the total duration of study 
including interruptions does not exceed twice the standard duration of

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 provision of Section 14(7) does not constitute an entitlement to 
recognition with credits. The recognition is decided on by the dean (or 
an authorized vice-dean) based on the student’s request.</p>
<p>The provision of Section 14(7) concerns in particular those students 
who study in a follow-up master’s programme and in the previous duly 
completed bachelor’s programme gained more credits than the minimum 
value. These “surplus” credits may be transferred to the follow-up 
programme upon a request for recognition. However, both of the following
 requirements must be fulfilled when the provision is applied.</p>
<p>The requirement of Section 14(1) under which only those courses may 
be recognized (with or without credits) that are compulsory or selective
 in relation to the studies for which they are recognized, and, as the 
case may be, other courses determined by the dean. The provision of 
Section 6(4) defines the minimum credit value of the studies. Only the 
number of credits gained by the student in the previous studies 
exceeding the minimum credit value of these previous studies may be 
transferred to the subsequent (e.g. follow-up master’s) studies.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> The minimum credit value of studies in 
the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student completed the 
studies within the standard duration and as part of the studies 
completed courses X (6 credits), Y (8 credits) and Z (4 credits), which 
are prescribed as compulsory in the follow-up master’s programme. Thus 
the student gained 190 credits in the bachelor’s studies. The student 
can have all the three courses recognized to the follow-up master’s 
programme. However, only 10 credits will be transferred to the minimum 
credit value of the master’s programme (not 18, which was the real value
 of the courses).</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The minimum credit value of studies in 
the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the 
studies after 7 semesters (he studied one semester longer than the 
standard duration) and gained 200 credits. This number does not exceed 
the value of 7 x 30 = 210, prescribed by Section 14(7). No credits can 
be transferred to the follow-up master’s studies. However, if the 
student completed some courses which are compulsory or selective for the
 follow-up master’s studies in which he is enrolled, such courses may be
 recognized without credits.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> The minimum credit value of studies in 
the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the 
studies after 5 semesters (one semester less than the standard duration)
 and gained 200 credits. With reference to Section 14(7), the student 
requests the transfer of courses worth (200–5 x 30) = 50 credits to the 
follow-up master’s studies. However, courses worth 50 credits cannot be 
recognized even if they were compulsory or selective courses, because 
after the deduction, the credit value attributable previous bachelor’s 
studies would decrease to 200–50 = 150 credits, which is below the 
minimum credit value of the studies. Therefore, only 20 credits may be 
recognized; potential further courses may be recognized without credits.</p>
<p>The provision of Section 14(7) also applies to students who duly 
completed any studies and wish to have certain courses recognized to 
subsequent studies. If, for example, the student has a bachelor’s 
diploma in Mathematics and his further studies will be the bachelor’s 
programme in Physics, all the courses in maths can be recognized in the 
subsequent studies from the point of content. However, in case he gained
 the minimum credit value (180 credits) in his bachelor’s studies of 
maths, the courses will be recognized with zero credit value. In fact it
 means that the student cannot get another diploma for courses 
recognized on the grounds of content similarity. He must achieve the 
minimum credit value of the studies again.</p>
<p>This situation differs from concurrent studies, where credits may be gained concurrently.</p>
<p>If subjects with a credit value were recognized or recorded for the 
student in the course of study that was terminated in accordance with § 
55 of the Act from a previous study, then the amount of these credits 
must be deducted from the total amount of credits in the course of study
 that was terminated in accordance with § 55 of the Act exceed thirty 
times the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the number of 
semesters, and that is if it would be possible to recognize credits, 
which in aggregate amount exceed thirty times the duration of duly 
completed studies expressed in the number of semesters, for the purposes
 of further study.</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(8)	The aggregate amount of credits recognized in accordance with 
subsection 1 is excluded from the number of credits used for assessing 
the fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in the next semester under 
Section 12(2)(a), (b) and (d); however, it is included in the number of 
credits used for assessing whether minimum credit value was reached as 
well as for assessing the fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in 
the next semester according to Section 12(2)(c).</p>

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 credit value of recognized courses is not relevant for the assessment 
of the right to enrol in the next semester under Section 12(2)(a), (b)

<p>On the other hand, the credit value of courses recognized from 
previous studies is included into the minimum credit value of the 
studies for which these courses were recognized with credits, which also
 includes the assessment whether the student has the right to enrol in 
the next semester under Section 12(2)(c).</p><p></p></div></div>

<p>(9)	No part of the final state examination, doctoral state 
examination or, in the fields of General Medicine and Dentistry, the 
advanced master’s state examination can be recognized from previous or 
concurrent studies.</p>
<p>(10)	For the purposes of assessing the fulfilment of the requirements
 for study, all compulsory and selective courses (Section 8(3)) 
completed at MU during the course of previous unsuccessful studies, 
including their credit value, are automatically included, as long as the

 doctoral thesis defence is separate from the doctoral state 
examination. It is always held after the exam. It can be held on the 
same day as the doctoral state examination or it may be held later (even
 by several semesters).</p>
<p>In case the student fails the doctoral state examination held on the 
same day as the thesis defence, they are not allowed to defend their 
thesis. The examination has to be first passed on a resit date.</p><p></p></div></div>


<p>(2)	The dean is entitled to designate a deadline for application submission.</p>
<p>(3)	The application under subsection 1 is submitted by the student to the dean. The application must include:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>the doctoral thesis submitted via the IS MU,
	</li><li>the doctoral thesis abstract,
	</li><li>the list of the student’s works published and/or accepted for publication,
	</li><li>the student’s professional CV,
	</li><li>other requisites determined in the programme specification.</li></ol>
<p>The requisites in terms of content and form under clauses b) to e) 
may be determined by the dean or the doctoral board; such requisites are
 published in the public section of the faculty website.</p>
<p>(4)	The date of the doctoral thesis defence is set by the dean on the
 proposal of the doctoral board. In the event that the defence cannot 
take place within one year after submitting the application for reasons 
worthy of special consideration, the dean shall decide on the date in 
such a way that it does not exceed the total duration of study under 
Section 29; the dean shall inform the student on the reasons for such a 
decision.</p>
<p>(5)	The supervisor shall prepare their opinion of the doctoral thesis
 and shall submit it in such a way that the student can read it via the 
IS MU theses archive no later than seven days before the defence.</p>
<p>(6)	The dean following a recommendation by the doctoral board shall 
appoint at least two doctoral thesis reviewers who are not employed by 
MU. The supervisor, a former supervisor, a co-author under Section 31(2)
 or a person in a similar role cannot be appointed as a reviewer. It is 
not admissible to appoint an additional reviewer in the event of a 
difference of opinion between reviewers.</p>
<p>(7)	Each reviewer compiles a report in Czech, Slovak or English or in
 a language designated for the defence purposes in the doctoral 
programme specification. Thesis reports assess the quality of a doctoral
 thesis, a student’s contribution and their ability of independent 
creative activity in the given area of research. The linguistic and 
formal aspects of the thesis shall also be assessed. The conclusion of 
each report must explicitly state whether the student has demonstrated 
their creative abilities in the relevant research area. The reviewer 
shall submit the report in such a way that the student can read it via 
the IS MU theses archive no later than seven days before the defence.</p>
<p>(8)	The doctoral thesis defence is held in the language of a given 
programme or in a language designated for the defence purposes in the 
doctoral programme specification. Unless expressly prohibited by the 
programme specification, the thesis defence may always be held in 
English or Slovak or another language usual in the field of science 
concerned.</p>
<p>(9)	The result of the doctoral thesis defence is assessed as “passed”
 or “failed”. A successful defence of a doctoral thesis which in its 
relevance and quality significantly exceeds the usual standards can be 
assessed as “passed summa cum laude”.</p>
<p>(10)	In case a student fails the doctoral thesis defence, they are 
entitled to repeat the defence no more than once. The resit date and the
 thesis defence board are determined by the dean following a 
recommendation by the doctoral board. The resit date must be scheduled 
within the next two semesters. In case the studies are interrupted until
 the resit, Section 13(3) shall apply. The conditions for a repeated 
defence must be specified by the board no later than one month following
 the failed defence attempt. In case a student fails both the doctoral 
thesis defence and the resit, the studies shall be terminated in 
accordance with Section 56(1)(b) of the Act, by the procedure set out in
 Section 68 of the Act.</p>

advisory capacity. In case the reviewer is not a member of the board, 
they are entitled to attend the non-public part of the board’s 
discussion in an advisory capacity.</p>
<p>(6)	The board constitutes a quorum if at least half of its members 
appointed in accordance with subsection 53(2) of the Act are present, 
including the chair, and simultaneously if at least one of the members 
not employed by MU is present. The state examination or the doctoral 
thesis defence may be held only provided the board constitutes a quorum.</p>
<p>(7)	In justified cases, the chair of the board is entitled to decide 
on the use of remote communication means during the board’s session, the
 doctoral state examination and doctoral thesis defence. The dean is 
entitled to set further conditions of remote communication.</p>
<p>(8)	The result of the doctoral state examination or doctoral thesis 
defence are discussed by the board in closed session by secret ballot. 
The method of voting shall be determined by the chair of the board based
 on the practice of the faculty; the IS MU may be used for voting. The 
“passed” grade requires a majority of votes of members present; in the 
opposite case, the grade shall be “failed”. The board takes written 
minutes in printed or electronic form from the course and assessment of 
the doctoral state examination and doctoral thesis defence.</p></div></li><li class="accordion-item  " data-accordion-item="" id="szr_35"><a class="accordion-title app-heading app-heading-ready" href="#" aria-controls="mbcjxo-accordion" role="tab" id="szr_35" aria-expanded="false" aria-selected="false"><span class="cislo_otazky">35.</span>Section 35 – Special Provisions on Studies Implemented in Collaboration with a Foreign Institution<a href="#szr_35" class="isi-link-h30 app-heading-ico"></a></a><div class="accordion-content " data-tab-content="" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="szr_35" aria-hidden="true" id="mbcjxo-accordion"><p>(1)

<div class="vyklad_pruvodce_rozklik"><div class="pruvodce_rozklik"><span class="barva1"><i class="isi-bublina" aria-hidden="true"></i>Explanation</span><p></p><p>The
 doctoral thesis defence is separate from the doctoral state examination
 (it may be held on the same day; then it will follow the exam).</p>
<p>These transitional provisions only regulate the doctoral thesis 
defence, not the doctoral state examination, which is governed by the 
provisions of the Study and Examination Regulations valid and effective 
from 1 September 2024 without any transitional limitations.</p>
<p>The <strong>date of the doctoral state examination</strong>
 is decisive for the application of the correct version of the 
Regulations. If the examination is held before 1 September 2024, the 
Regulations valid and effective at the time of the examination are used 
for the composition of the examination board, manner of assessment and 
other requisites, i.e. the version valid until 31 August 2024. If the 
examination is held on 1 September 2024 or later, the “new” Regulations 
valid and effective from 1 September 2024 apply.</p>
<p>The date of submitting the doctoral thesis defence application is 
decisive for the use of the correct version of the Regulations to the 
organization of the doctoral thesis defence. If the application is 
submitted before 1 September 2024, the composition of the examination 
board, manner of assessment and other requisites are governed by the 
Regulations valid and effective until 31 August 2024. The provisions of 
the Study and Examination Regulations valid and effective from 1 
September 2024 will be used for the defences for which the students 
applied on 1 September 2024 or later. A potential resit is again 
scheduled in accordance with the Regulations valid and effective at the 
time of the application submission.</p>
<p>In case the doctoral state examination and the doctoral thesis 
defence are held on the same day, the date of the exam will be decisive 
for the organization of the exam (if the date is prior to 1 September 
2024, the Regulations valid and effective until 31 August 2024 will 
apply). For the organization of the defence, the date of submitting the 
application will be decisive (if submitted before 1 September 2024, the 
Regulations valid and effective until 31 August 2024 will apply). Thus, 
for a limited time, a situation may occur where the examination and the 
defence held on the same day will be organized according to different 
rules.</p><p></p></div></div>
