 applications for teachers (Teacher‘s Notebook), you need to specify 
which mode you want to work in. The system gives you a choice between 
the courses you teach in a given semester and those that are set up in 
the Catalog so that grades can be entered by all teachers (group 
projects, supervision of theses, etc.). If you have the s_vyuka access 
right, you are offered a choice of other departmental courses. On the 
course selection page, always check the faculty and the semester 
selected at the top.

         On each page of the Teacher's Notebook, you have a header with 
an overview of the selected courses. On the right hand side, you will 
find a drop-down menu called "Applications", which you can use to view 
links to each Teacher’s Notebook application. With these links, you can 
easily navigate to other Teacher‘s Notebook applications without having 
to return to the front page.  
         <p>
         The Teacher‘s Notebook header also shows the date and time the 
selection was made. If there have been any changes to the selection 
since then, you can recalculate the data by selecting "update".

 filters listed below can be applied to the student list. We may want to
 filter the list of students enrolled in selected courses, e.g. to 
students enrolled for one or more specific examination dates, restrict 
the list to a selected seminar group, restrict the list to students 
repeating the course, etc. 
  
<p>
If you check multiple filters at the same time, you can select the 
operator (AND, OR) that will be used to concatenate the filters. Thus, 
you can include in the selection persons who meet all the conditions 
simultaneously (AND) or meet at least one of the conditions (OR). By 
default setting, all conditions are to be met simultaneously (AND). 
</p><p>
Any number of filters can be applied at the same time. For example, if 
we check simultaneously "restrict to students repeating the course as a 
result of failing to complete it" and "restrict to students who have 
failed to complete the course" filters, we get a list of students likely
 to fail their study. 

</p><p>
To apply a filter, check the required course(s) at the top, then check 
the required filter(s) at the bottom, and then click the Selected button
 below the checked course. It is assumed that you select course without 
filters more often than you select course applying filters.
</p><p>
To change the current filter, click on the "change filter". 
</p><p>
For your information, the current list of enabled filters is displayed 
at the top of each page. Please pay due attention to it.

courses. Check one or more of the offered completition types.
              </dd><dt><strong>selected by enrolment in some other course</strong>
              </dt><dd>The selection of students will be limited to 
students who are or have been enrolled in a course specified by its code
 during the selected period. Case is not considered when entering the 
code. If the code is not entered, the filter will not be applied. If you
 select "any term" then it will filter to those students who have or 
have had a course entered by code in any of the terms. The student does 
not have to have taken the course in the same study, students who have 
taken the course in any of their studies will be included (assessed via 
individuals, not studies).
              </dd><dt><strong>who completed another course</strong>
              </dt><dd>A page to specify will be displayed to select the
 term and course code of the course taken. You can select whether the 
student must have taken all courses or only some of the courses listed.

 </dd><dt><strong>who have not enrolled in the course, but only 
registered for it (use in combination with the extend the list to 
registered students option)</strong>
              </dt><dd>Only those students who are not enrolled in the 
selected course, but only registered for it, will be included in the 
list. When selecting this filter, you must also extend the list to 
include registered students. It is also important to note that the check
 for automatic student enrollment in a course always takes place around 
midnight. The data obtained by this selection is therefore current as of
 that date.</dd></dl>

students who are currently studying in the designated semester. Semester
 evaluation is done at the current point in time and not at the time the
 course was/will be taught. Only active (not interrupted or completed) 
studies are selected. A student may study more than one active studies 
in one semester and may be in a different semester in each of studies. 
Therefore, one student may be in multiple semesters at the same time.
              </dd><dt><strong>selected by the stage, year or block currently enrolled in</strong>
              </dt><dd>The selection of students can be limited to 
students who are currently studying a particular stage/year/block 
(depending on the terminology used in the faculty). See also the notes 
on semester filters. Here the analogy applies. The faculty does not need
 to record the stage/year/block at all.
              </dd><dt><strong>selected by study group</strong>
              </dt><dd>Some faculties use a numerical attribute of study
 – study group. The student is thus assigned to a specific study group 
for the entire period of study (or at least until the study group number
 changes). This study group is applied to all courses studied in the 
degree programme.  
<p>
After selecting this filter, a page to specify will appear with a list 
of study groups to which students registered for the selected courses 
belong. Check the required study group(s).</p></dd></dl>

those students who are enrolled in a particular topic from the course 
topic list. A course topic list is one that is linked to a specific 
course in which the student will participate. It is not a topic list of 
theses. You have to first select this filter and confirm with the "Apply
 filter" button. Then choose one or more topics from the course topic 
list and confirm the choice with the "Select" button.

requirements (those who have met requirements in all attendance 
notebooks), with students who did not meet attendance requirements 
(those who have not met requirements in at least one attendance

 a group of students on the basis of. You have to confirm the selection 
by clicking on the button "Select".

              </dt><dd>The selection of students can also be limited by 
the word given in the selected notebook. The word can only be made up of
 letters, numbers, asterisk (*), at sign (@) and underscore (_). This 
filter can also be used to select students who, on the other hand, do 
not have the word in the notebook. You have to first select this filter

 you can find your past selections at the top of the Teacher‘s Notebook 
page under the "Selections used before" link. Clicking on this link will
 show you all of your previous selections. You can then select two

created and saved.  
<p>
The second option is the "Update the students in the selection and use 
it" option. Use this when you want to update the list of students 
according to the created condition. For example, if you have selected 
students in a previous selection with no evaluation recorded and you 
want to return to this selection later, but with the current number of 
students who still have not any evaluation recorded, you would select 
the "Update the students in the selection and use it" option. This will

do, please contact istech@fi.muni.cz). You can use the application if 
you need to select students through complex combined conditions, e.g. 
across multiple terms, multiple periods, etc. To make an advanced 
selection, first select the course(s) you want to use the selection for,
 click on "change filter" and then "advanced selections". For example, 
if you have selected students from a previous selection and want to 
choose further filters on the selection, check the button to include the
 currently selected group of students in the new selection and select 
the operator to combine the two selections (AND, OR, MINUS). This allows
 you to gradually create a whole chain of selections. If you do not 
check the button to include the currently selected group of students, 
the choice of operators disappears and only the current request is 
recorded.
