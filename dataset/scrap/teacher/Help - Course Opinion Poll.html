							The course opinion poll, which is anonymous, provides teachers 
and their superiors with useful feedback related to their courses. The 
information is collected via an electronic questionnaire only filled out
 by the students enrolled in these
							courses. Students provide answers during examination period and 
after its end the results of the poll are published. Assessed teachers 
are informed about them by e-mail. Continuous monitoring of the results 
during the examination period has
							been cancelled since the spring semester 2019.

							Students can only answer the questions related to the courses 
they have signed up for in the current term. Answers are provided for 
the teachers listed in the Course Catalogue as lecturers or seminar 
tutors. On encountering a course or seminar group listing which includes
 unknown teachers, students are instructed not to respond to such 
course–teacher combinations or otherwise take advantage of the 
opportunity to provide "no answer" and thus avoid
							the distortion of results. Likewise, in case the listing includes
 a course or seminar group students have not attended, they are 
encouraged to provide no response.
						</p>
						<p>
							Answers should always be associated with a specific teacher in 
case he/she is designated as a lecturer. Students also provide answers 
to the questions related to the seminar groups in which they have 
enrolled. Provided a seminar group has several teachers assigned, they 
do so for these separately. If it is a seminar group which has no 
teacher specified, it is included in the opinion poll as the one with no
 teacher assigned. If there are no seminar groups established for the 
course, then those identified as seminar tutors will be offered to all 
students in the course for evaluation in the survey. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If a course has no teacher specified, it is included in the opinion poll as the one with no teacher assigned.
						</p>
						<p>
							No answers are provided for the ones listed as alternate examiners, assistants, or deputies.

					<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content="" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="2pxgra-accordion-label" aria-hidden="true" id="2pxgra-accordion">
						<p>
							Beginning with the autumn 2016 semester, the course opinion poll 
consists of 6 questions. Since autumn 2023 one new question was added, 
since autumn 2024 one question was deleted, i.e. still a total of 6 
questions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first question focuses on the course as a coherent unit 
within a given semester, i.e. including any seminar groups taking place 
within the framework of such a course. Only one answer is thus required,
 regardless of how many teachers are actually associated with such a 
course. Answer to this question is saved for the entire course (i.e. all
 course–teacher and seminar group–tutor combinations) regardless of 
which course teacher or tutor the question was answered for.
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>The course is of educational value to me; it enriches me.</strong>
 – The question requires students to provide an answer on a scale from 
"strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" with a given statement; if 
necessary, students may provide "no answer".</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							Four additional questions are associated with a particular course
 teacher or seminar group tutor. These questions are answered 
individually for each teacher. Answers indicate student opinion of each 
statement, expressed on a scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly 
disagree"; if necessary, students may provide "no answer".
						</p>

						<ol start="2">
							<li><strong>The teacher’s presentation of the subject matter was always clearly intelligible.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher was always well prepared for class.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher provided clear information regarding the knowledge and skills that will be evaluated.</strong></li>
							<li><strong>The teacher always communicated with and treated students with respect.</strong></li>
						</ol>

						<p>The final question is associated with a particular course 
teacher or seminar group tutor. This question is optional. Students may 
provide the teacher with comprehensive feedback, including critical 
comments as well as a positive evaluation of his/her work.
						</p>

						<ol start="6">
							<li><strong>In your opinion, what does the teacher excel in? What
 do you value most in their course or in their approach to teaching? Do 
you have any recommendations regarding the teacher's lessons or approach
 to teaching?</strong> – The
								answer
								provided in the form of a written commentary.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							<strong>What are faculty-specific questions?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Faculties may include specific questions in the course opinion 
poll. Faculty-specific questions are mandatory. They are marked with the
 faculty abbreviation and faculty-specific question sequence number in 
the course opinion poll form.
							Faculty-specific questions are only associated with courses 
taught at a faculty which has opted to include its own questions in the 
course opinion poll. Faculties making use of this option currently 
include the MU Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Law, 
Faculty of Social Studies, Faculty of Informatics and Faculty of Sports 
Studies.

							Course opinion poll results are published following the end of 
the response collection period to those students who completed at least 
half of their enrolled courses or for no less than ten courses of given 
semester in total (in order for a course to be considered complete, they
 must answer all of the mandatory questions [no. 1-5 + faculty-specific 
questions] for at least one course–teacher or seminar group–tutor 
combination). Furthermore, course opinion poll results are also 
displayed to all evaluated teachers and their superiors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Responses are only published in case all mandatory questions for a
 given course have been answered by at least 10 % of all enrolled 
students and no less than five students in total. Students who 
sufficiently completed the course opinion poll may view the results of 
all sufficiently filled out courses at MU (except the student written 
comments). Teachers may additionally view the results of insufficiently 
filled out courses by clicking on "completed by at least one student" or
 "containing at least one answer" in the course list.

							Questions 1 to 5 required students to provide an answer on a 
scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree" with a given 
statement; if necessary, students were also given the option to provide 
"no answer". These answers are
							displayed in an interactive graph with response rates.
						</p>
						<p>
							The <strong>interactive graph</strong> allows users to click on 
an item in order to hide/show the proportion of a selected category in 
the graph. Placing your cursor on individual response categories will 
display a percentage; pointing to the
							question itself will display the full question text (hidden in 
the case of small screens).

							Columns next to the graph indicate the number of students who 
provided answers to a question relevant to a specific course (question 
1) or teacher (questions 2 to 5), mean course and teacher score at a 
given faculty and mean selected course
							and teacher score.
						</p>
						<p>
							Question 6 requires students to provide an answer in the form of a
 voluntary written response which is only displayed to teachers and 
their superiors (for example course guarantor has the right to read 
written comments related to course
							teachers; course lecturer has the right for comments related to 
seminar tutors and other lecturers as well), i.e. not to students. The 
Faculty of Social Studies is the only exception to this rule; faculty 
management have decided to display
							all written responses anonymously to teachers and students alike.
 Student comments begin with the wording of the question or course 
designation and the name of the evaluated course teacher.

							Teachers and course guarantors have the opportunity to <strong>respond to course opinion poll results</strong>
 by including their comments in a text box located below the results of a
 given course. They must heed the fact that written student
							comments
							may not be displayed for students (they are visible only for 
teacher and his/her superior). Therefore, should a teacher or a course 
guarantor wish to react to a written comment, they are encouraged to 
include the comment itself in their

for a given course and teacher.
						</p>
						<p>
							Moreover, course guarantors have the opportunity to copy their 
comments either to the entire course (i.e. all course–teacher and 
seminar group–tutor combinations) or to all courses they guarant.
						</p>

							The teachers and the course guarantors may input their reactions 
only for a limited time after the results publication. A deadline is 
shown near the text box for the comments.

							<strong>Results sorted by course:</strong> Student responses to 
questions 1 to 6 are displayed for each selected pair of course–teacher

							<strong>Results sorted by question:</strong> In the case of 
question 1 (i.e. question regarding the course as a whole), student

of selected course teachers and instructors. In the case of questions 2 
to 6 (i.e. questions regarding individual teachers), student responses 
are displayed for each selected course teacher or instructor.

							<strong>Results sorted by respondents:</strong> For each selected
 pair course–teacher or seminar group–tutor, all replies of individual 
respondents of the subject opinion poll to individual questions replied 
by them are displayed in
							descending order.
							Answers are provided in word form (i.e. "strongly agree", 
"agree", "somewhat agree", "somewhat disagree", "disagree", "strongly 
disagree" or "no answer"); alternatively, students may include a written
 comment specific to an individual
							teacher. The respondents are then identified in the list of
