      <p>You can specify the order in which the questions of each set should be
in succession - write the desired order in the box in front of "set
order" in the grey rectangle.</p> 
       

<p>You can also specify how questions from the set should be selected 
for the test if you are selecting only a subset of the questions from 
the set. You can choose either to select them "randomly", to "start from
 the question", or to take "a block of continuous questions".</p>
<p><strong>Random</strong> means that a given number of questions are randomly selected from all questions in the set.</p>
<p><strong>Start from the question</strong> means that a given number of
 questions are selected in the same order as they appear in the set, 
starting with question X. In the case of non-completion, start with 
question 1 in the set.</p>
<p><strong>A block of continuous questions</strong> means that it is 
possible to take into account cases where there are always the same 
number of related questions in a set of "tasks". The number of questions
 that form a continuous block in the set is entered (the total number of
 questions in the set must be divisible by this number). Just one 
randomly selected block of continuous questions from the set is used.</p>
<p>You set the order of the questions in the student's test (in the session) in the next step in "<strong>Order of questions in a new session</strong>".</p>

<p>
Once a student has launched the ROPOT and created a session in it (or
an assignment for a scannable test is created), the assignment is kept
unchanged even if some of the questions are later changed or removed
by the teacher. In the Responses application, it is thus always
possible to see exactly what the questions looked like when the
student answered them.<br>

 If you want to keep the same number of points for all questions 
regardless of the number of "ok"s, you can do this by specifying a score
 in the question set. In our case, this would mean specifying 0.25 for 
each "ok" (ok 0.25). The value can also be specified using a percentage 
(ok 25%).</p></div>

 the ROPOT description, just chose "save/yes" in the "Saving students' 
scores to a notebook" section in combination with the default score 
setting. IS MU will automatically create a notebook where the number of 
points awarded will be saved. Only points are transferred, not, for 
example, free-form answers.</p>
 
	<p>The "yes" option is further divided into the following options:</p>
	<ul><li><strong>"Save only the score of the last ROPOT session (last test)":</strong>
		  this option is mainly used when setting "Yes, they should, but it is
 always the same form (same questions) that should be offered to them". 
However, you can also use this option if you are repeatedly setting up 
new tests, if only the most recent result is important for you and for 
the students.
	  </li><li><strong>"yes, only the best result (of all the ROPOT sessions)":</strong>
 
	          this option is most often used in combination with 
"Passed/failed evaluation". The student launches the ROPOT application 
repeatedly in order to achieve a certain number of points.
          </li><li><strong>"yes, only the worst result (of all the ROPOT sessions)":</strong>
                  used when you want the student to answer only once but
 have the option to launch the ROPOT application a second time, e.g. in 
case of a failure. It cannot be used in combination with the 
"Passed/failed evaluation" option.
          </li><li><strong>"yes, the results last submitted of all the sessions":</strong>
                 only makes sense if you intend to allow students to 
repeatedly launch new, blank tests (see below). If they take the test 
once and then just correct the answers (i.e. "update the same form"), 
the score is always overwritten by the last result.
          </li><li><strong>"yes, all the results submitted of all the sessions":</strong>
                 used in cases where the student passes the ROPOT 
repeatedly and it is desirable to record the results of all answers 
concerning one ROPOT. For example, you can keep track of whether the 
student is continuously improving or deteriorating while completing the 
test.
          </li><li><strong>"Save only the score of the last ROPOT session (last test) and the scores gained for individual sets":</strong>
                 use this option in exceptional situations where you 
need to differentiate the points earned from each question set.</li></ul>

check if the limit has been met, enter the required number of points in 
the "a pass score or pass percentage" field in the “Passed/failed

 pass the test as a percentage. For example, if you enter "75%", the 
test will be scored as a pass if the student earns 75% or more of the 
maximum number of points. At the same time, you need to set the results

<br>If a student achieves the minimum score in one of the ROPOT 
sessions, a *1 will appear in the notebook, which in this case means 
"passed", not the number of points obtained. If the student does not 
achieve the minimum number of points, the student will have a *0 in the 
notebook.

	<p>
Expressing the achievement of the minimum score in terms of ones and 
zeros makes it easy to see how many ROPOTs a student has completed by 
adding up the notebooks. 
You can also list students who have or have not achieved the required 
number of points. When selecting a course in the "Teacher" agenda, also 
select the filter "other - students" and specifically "selected by their
 score recorded in a notebook". Then tick the required notebook and 
enter the number of points. For a listing of students who have passed 
the ROPOT requirements, this will be "=1" and for a listing of students 
who have not passed the ROPOT requirements, this will be "=0". The

Beware of settings in which you combine the percentages set in 
"Passed/failed evaluation" and any of the options "yes, the results last
 submitted of all the sessions" or "yes, all the results submitted of 
all the sessions" in the "Saving students' scores to a notebook" 
section. With this setting, the sesion is evaluated by taking the 
maximum points that the responder could have earned as the basis for 
calculating the percentage and comparing that to the points actually 
earned.

 
	<br><strong>Example:</strong> 
a maximum of 10 points can be earned on a test and it has to be 
completed to at least 80% in order for the student to find "*1 
completed" in the notebook, however, the notebook is set to store all 
the results submitted of all the sessions. A student who has one session
 in this test has to score at least 8 points to find "*1 pass" in the 
notebook. A student with two sessions needs to score at least 16 points 
in total, a student with three sessions must score at least 24 points in
 total, etc.

	<ul><li><strong>Setting the from-to interval (period during which the application can be worked with)</strong><br>
		You can select the date and time from and until which the ROPOT can be
 worked with. You can either enter both data or only one of them. You 
can set more than one interval for accessing the ROPOT.

	  </li><li><strong>Setting the total time for the test</strong><br>
		Another option is to specify the total number of minutes that the 
ROPOT 
can be worked with. The time is counted for each person separately from 
the moment the ROPOT session is first launched. Although the teacher can
 set the student to return to the ROPOT session and work with it 
repeatedly, the total time is still counted from the first time the 
ROPOT session is launched.

	  </li><li><strong>Combining the two methods</strong><br>
		You can combine both types of time restriction. The limit that expires
 first will apply. For example, you have a ROPOT where the interval is 
set to 15:00 to 16:00 and 10 minutes. If a student launches the ROPOT at
 15:55, they will only have 5 minutes to answer it. If he/she opens it 
at 15:00, he/she will have 10 minutes.</li></ul>

        
<p>The combination of time constraints can be used, for example, in real
 examinations for grades. For example, you want to give students 30 
minutes of time and at the same time you don't want students to lose 
some of their time due to a delay in the start of the test. In such a 
situation it is convenient to set the interval e.g. 10:00–11:30 and at 
the same time the total number of minutes to 30. Each student will have 
30 minutes to work and it does not matter whether he/she opens the test 
at 10:00 or 10:05. Only students who open the test at 11:01 or later 
would be disadvantaged.</p>

	<p>You can do the same in tests designed for practice during the 
semester. For example, you want students to work with the ROPOT 
repeatedly over a period of time (e.g., March to May), but only for a 
limited amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes). In this type of testing, you 
need to have the parameter "yes, they should and some other questions 
should be offered to them next time they work with the ROPOT 
application". This is because if you set it to "yes, they should, but it
 is always the same form (same questions) that should be offered to 
them", the time from the first time the ROPOT session is launched is 
counted. In our case, if the student saved the test after 10 minutes and
 came back to it after half an hour, he/she would not be able to work 
with it anymore because the 20 minutes would have passed in the 
meantime.</p>

        <p>Multiple periods during which the ROPOT can be worked with is
 useful in the case of tests on multiple dates for different groups or 
seminars within a course or courses using shared study materials. This 
eliminates the need to create multiple ROPOT descriptions for a single 
test that is intended for different groups of students. It is also 
important that all groups of students who are to work with the ROPOT at a
 given time also have the appropriate rights assigned. For example, you 
want to give one test to two groups of students. The first examination 
date is at 10:00, the second at 14:00. In the ROPOT description, you set
 the date and time in the first line to, for example, 10:00–11:00, and 
in the second line to 14:00–15:00. Thus, one description is used for two
 examination dates.</p>

 
	<p>With both types of time constraints, the student can see how much 
time is left. For the last 5 minutes, a red warning appears on the 
counter indicating the end of the test and flashes for the last minute.</p>

<p>For example: a teacher teaches three seminar groups on a different
day each, and he/she wants to set up one ROPOT for all groups so that
only students from a particular seminar group can always launch the
ROPOT on the day the seminar group is taught.</p>

<p>For each seminar group, via the "Add another rights and time group" 
button, the teacher inserts a section within which he/she sets the right
 for the specific seminar group and sets the time when the student is 
allowed to launch the ROPOT session.</p>

<p>This way, the teacher doesn't have to set up three different ROPOTs, but just one.</p>

The teacher usually uses the key (password) when he/she does not know
exactly when the students will take the ROPOT. Typical use is, for
example, in seminars where ROPOTs are taken every week. The teacher
sets an interval in the ROPOT description for answering throughout the
seminar, but only makes it available to students by handing in the key
(password) when he or she deems it appropriate. This will ensure that
students do not access the ROPOT until instructed to do so.

</p><h3>Universal key and individual keys</h3>

Each group of rights and times has its own key generated. Furthermore, 
one universal key is created. This key unlocks the ROPOT for all those 
who have the right to work with the ROPOT. A second possible universal 
key unlocks the ROPOT for all special rights and times groups. 
Individual keys will always unlock the ROPOT for a given rights and 
times group.

<p>Students have a box to insert a key next to the "Launch the new ROPOT application" button.</p>

 you can. In addition to automatic evaluation (i.e. where the student's 
answers are evaluated according to pre-set scores), there is also the 
option of manual evaluation of answers. This mode of evaluation must 
first be enabled in the ROPOT description.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>Where do I add my manual evaluation to the student's answers?</h3>

After answering the ROPOT, student answers are displayed in the 
Responses application. The "Evaluate manually" button appears in batch 
operations. The button is also displayed if the option is not set in the
 ROPOT description and leads to its activation.

Manual evaluation can be entered for each question separately by clicking on "Evaluate manually" in the submitted ROPOT session.

Both text and scores can be entered in the manual evaluation field. 
Points always has to be marked with an asterisk. The left panel shows 
the number of points awarded automatically, manually and the total 
number of points.
<p>
</p><p>
If the teacher is working on the evaluation of more than one question, 
the manual evaluation can be saved in bulk by clicking on "Uložit 
všechny změny v ručním hodnocení" (i.e. Save all changes in manual 
evaluation in English).

<p>
</p><h3>Where the manual evaluation is stored?</h3>

Manual evaluations are stored in the notebook. The teacher can choose 
whether this notebook is published to students immediately, not at all, 
or only after a certain date. If the teacher does not wish to save the 
content in the notebook, then the option should be checked there, 
"Nechci obsah propisovat do poznámkového bloku" (i.e. I don't want to 
store the content in the notebook in English) The manual evaluation will
 still be available to the teacher in the Responses application.
<p>
</p><p>
The notebook created by the "manual evaluation" mode will be marked as such.

<p>
</p><h3>In what format is the manual evaluation displayed in the notebook?</h3>

Depending on the teacher's preference, the manual evaluation in the 
notebook will be displayed as full text with points (which are always 
marked with an asterisk), points only or total sum of points. Manual 
evaluation can also be listed for each question separately.
<p>
</p><p>
The notebook abbreviation option is used when the content is to be included in the custimized addition notebook.
