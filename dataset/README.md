# Dataset
All pages were scraped from [Help](https://is.muni.cz/napoveda/?lang=en).

## Data Filtering
Some of the pages are not translated, therefore after we extract
Q&A format, we will have to translate those pages using some external
tool. One of the websites refering to the "Recognized parential period"
is in pdf file format and does not resemble Q&A format.

## TODO
 - [ ] Extract Q&A dataset from the pages.
 - [ ] Translate extracted data.
