                "answer": "The tuition fee\n\n is payable by a student who has exceeded his/her standard period of \nstudy by one year. It should be stressed here that the total duration of\n each study includes (and must include) the duration of any studies \ncompleted other than graduating, unless the student has completed \n(graduated) a study programme of the same type after the completion of \nsuch studies (the types of study programmes relevant for the fee \nobligation are Bachelor's and Master's degrees). A period of time when \nmore than one \"failed\" field of study was underway concurrently is \ncounted only once. The fact that a 'failed' field of study ran \nconcurrently with another properly completed study does not prevent it \nfrom being counted towards the total period of study of the subsequent \nfield of study.\n\n\nIn the event that a student completes any of his/her studies graduating,\n previously completed studies of the same type shall cease to count \ntowards the total period of study in any subsequent studies. Upon \nregular completion of a Bachelor's degree, periods of previous \nunsuccessful Bachelor's studies shall cease to be counted, and upon \ncompletion of a Master's degree (both non-continuing and continuing), \nperiods of Master's studies previously completed other than by \ngraduating (both non-continuing and continuing) shall cease to be \ncounted. \n\n\nThe period of interrupted study and the period of study during the \nrecognised period of parenthood (Section 21(1)(f) of the Act) are not \ncounted towards the total period of study.\n\n",

                "answer": "If\n a student has been assessed a tuition fee, he/she has the right to file\n an appeal (by mail or in person at the faculty's study department) \nwithin 30 days, which may include a request for a waiver or reduction of\n the tuition fee. The last day for filing an appeal is always the\n\n30th day after the date of delivery of the decision\n. If this last day falls on a non-business day, the student may still submit the appeal on the first following business day.\n\n\nDetails of the appeal can be obtained by each student from the study \ndepartment of the relevant faculty. The student is required to explain \nand document the reasons for his/her request. When considering a \nstudent's request for a fee waiver or reduction, the student's academic \nperformance, social situation of the family, health reasons, \nparticipation in a study abroad or representation of Masaryk University \nare taken into account. It is not necessary to document the data that \ncan be found in the IS MU.\n\n\n\nThe obligation to pay the assessed fee does not cease even if the \nstudent ceases to study at MU during the period for which the fee was \nassessed. If the student wishes to have this circumstance taken into \naccount, he or she must also apply for a fee reduction or waiver within \nthe statutory time limit, even if it is uncertain at the time of the \napplication whether the termination or interruption of studies will take\n place at all. In such a case, the proceedings will be stayed after the \nappeal has been lodged until the student has actually completed or \ninterrupted his/her studies (or until it is clear that he/she will not).\n \n\n\nIf a student misses the 30-day deadline, this delay may be excused for \nvery serious and documented reasons\n,\n  that objectively prevented the student from submitting the application\n on time. In such a case, the appeal shall be submitted together with \nthe request for waiver of the missed deadline and the reasons therefor.\n\n",

The condition is that the final amount of the fee \nmust be divisible by six and at least CZK 6 000. The decision to \nallocate a standard instalment plan is simpler and quicker. \n\n\n\nThe student can also request an \nindividual repayment plan\n,to\n allow for any exceptions and individual entitlements.

The MU Information \nSystem takes into account information about the person and the person's \nstudies at MU. Information on a person's studies at other universities \nin the Czech Republic is taken from the student register. The subject of\n the examination are studies covered by the above-mentioned Higher \nEducation Act. These are studies which took place at least one day after\n 1 January 1999. This means that the period of studies (successfully, \nunsuccessfully) concluded before 1999 is not included in the \ncalculation. The duration of studies that started before 1999 and \ncontinued afterwards are included in the calculation in full. Only \nbachelor's and master's degrees are included in the calculation. \nDoctoral studies shall not be assessed a fee, nor shall the time spent \ntherein be taken into account when calculating the fee for other \nstudies. \n\n\n\nData from the \nstudent register\n  is taken twice a year. The study departments of individual MU faculties have the option of adding so-called \ncorrection records\n,\n to the student record records, which have higher validity and replace \nthe original student record records when calculating fees. In the same \nway, the study department can also add other studies of a foreign \nschool. However, the corrective record is deleted the next time the data\n is collected from the national student record, so it is always better \nto resolve discrepancies in the data at another university at that \nuniversity, which is the only one that can also correct its data for the\n national student record. Only information from the MU Information \nSystem is used to evaluate the course of study at MU. In these cases, \nthe information obtained from the registry is ignored.\n",

Each semester includes at least one week designated for \nenrolment in the semester, no less than three weeks for course \nenrolment, no less than twelve and no more than fifteen weeks of \nteaching time and at least six weeks of examination period, so that:\n\n\nthe examination period does not overlap with teaching \nwhile ending at least one day prior to the last day of the period \ndesignated for enrolment in the next semester,\n\t\nthe period designated for enrolment in the semester ends no \nlater than on the fifth working day following the first day of teaching \nin that semester,\n\t\nthe course enrolment period ends on the thirteenth calendar \nday following the first day of teaching in that semester with the \npossible exception of intensive and/or specially scheduled courses; \nenrolment regulations for such courses are specified by the dean in the \npublic section of the relevant website,\n\t\nthe course registration period precedes the course enrolment period.\n\n\nThe remainder of the semester constitutes vacation time.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n term \u201ccourse enrolment\u201d differs from \u201cenrolment in a semester\u201d.

Applications for enrolment in the next semester may be submitted \nand confirmed even after the classes in the given semester have started.\nIf the student has two or more concurrent studies, enrolment is made for\n each of the studies separately. By submitting an application for \nenrolment in the next semester, the student expresses their will to \ncontinue in the studies.\n\n\nExamination period\n is a period of time to which \nexaminers schedule the dates of course completion. It must not happen \nthat no completion date of a particular course is scheduled during the \nexam period. The beginning and end of the exam period are clearly \ndetermined by the academic year schedule, in accordance with the \nprovision of Section 3(1)(a). The possibility of completing a course \noutside the exam period is not excluded, depends, however, on the \nexaminer. The examiner may schedule the course completion dates before \nthe beginning as well as after the end of the exam period in accordance \nwith Section 16; however, they are not obliged to do so.\n\n\nCourse enrolment\n \u2013 within a defined period (the \nperiod of course registration and course enrolment \u2013 see Section 11), \nthe student electronically (via an IS MU application) applies for \ncourses they have chosen to study in the next semester. This is course \nregistration. The IS MU checks whether the requirements for enrolment in\n the respective courses have been met and, after potential shortcomings \nare corrected, automatically confirms the student\u2019s enrolment in such \ncourses.\n\n\nWhen the student attempts to register a course, problems may arise \nthat could prevent course enrolment (e.g. requirements not met, capacity\n exceeded, enrolment in a course not permitted for the given studies \netc.). Details about such issues can be displayed by clicking \u201cDetailed \ninformation\u201d in the relevant IS MU application. During the period for \nenrolment, the student is allowed to file a request for exemption (which\n must include a reasoning). In case the teacher (the guarantor or \nanother person in charge) approves the exemption, the obstacle \npreventing enrolment in the course is automatically removed.\n\n\nIf the student has two or more concurrent studies, course enrolment is made separately for each of the studies. \nApplications for course enrolment may be submitted and confirmed even after the classes in the given semester have started.\n\n\nThe student is allowed to make changes to their application for \ncourse enrolment, i.e. cancel the registration of a course, during the \nperiod for course enrolment.\n\n\n(2)\tSchedules containing the timing of the academic year and the \ndefinition of semester periods for course registration (Section 11) are \ndetermined by the Rector after a discussion with the deans in such a way\n that the teaching in the semester starts at all the faculties on the \nsame date, enrolment in the semester starts on the same date, the \nexamination period takes place simultaneously at all faculties for a \nduration of no less than three weeks, and the period for state \nexaminations (Sections 22 to 24) does not overlap for individual \nsemesters.\n\n\n(3) Weekly timetables are announced by the faculties prior to the \nfirst day of the course enrolment period in a given semester. Timetables\n of intensive courses and specially scheduled courses are announced by \nthe faculties no less than one week prior to the beginning of such \ncourses.\n\n\n(4)\tThe weekly timetables are determined by the faculty in such a way\n that the courses which constitute a study template do not overlap more \nthan absolutely necessary.",

                "answer": "(1)\n The fulfilment of study requirements in a programme (hereinafter \nreferred to as \u201cstudies\u201d) is recorded by means of a credit system based \non the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).\n\n\n(2) The basic unit of studies is a course identified by a unique \ncourse code. The amount of requirements necessary to complete a course \nis expressed by the number of credits assigned to that course \n(hereinafter referred to as the \u201ccredit value\u201d).\n\n\nExplanation\nEach\n course taught at MU faculties has a unique identification code. \nAlthough the contents of certain courses may be very similar, in \nacademic records they are considered to be different courses.\n\n\n(3) The credit value of a course, group of courses or stage of \nstudies is determined in accordance with ECTS principles so that it \ncorresponds to a standard workload of an average student; it is used for\n a course regardless of a programme or study mode.\n\n\nExplanation\n1 ECTS = 25\u201330 study hours.\n\n\n60 ECTS represents a workload necessary for one year of full-time studies (30 ECTS per semester).\n\n\nA course with a particular code can be prescribed for students of \ndifferent degree programmes implemented at different faculties. However,\n its credit value cannot vary according to a programme the student \npursues (the only way credit value may vary is determined by different \nmanners of course completion, if admissible).\n\n\n(4) A condition for the completion of studies in a programme or field\n of study is the acquisition of credits awarded for completing courses \nprescribed by the study plan, reaching at least the minimum credit \nvalue, i.e. thirty times the standard duration of study in a programme \nexpressed in the number of semesters.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n composition of a set of courses necessary for due completion of studies\n is prescribed by the degree programme and forms a part of accreditation\n documents. Students will find the information in study templates for \nthe course of studies in the IS MU. The standard duration of study of \nsome programmes in the combined mode is longer than that of programmes \nin the full-time mode, even though the programmes may have the same or \nsimilar contents. The minimum credit value of such programmes is \nidentical and equals the minimum credit value of the full-time programme\n or, as the case may be, the minimum credit value calculated using the \nshortest standard duration set by law for the relevant programme type. \nFor example, a master\u2019s degree programme in the combined mode was \naccredited as three-year and in the full-time mode as two-year; the \nminimum credit value of either is 120.\n\n\n(5) For the purpose of assessing the minimum credit value of studies, the following credits are recognized:\n\n\ncredits gained for courses completed during the studies,\n\t\ncredits recognized in accordance with Section 14,\n\t\ncredits automatically recorded in accordance with Section 14(10),\n\t\ncredits recognized in accordance with Section 60(2) of the \nAct, from credits gained for courses completed within lifelong learning.\n\n\nExplanation\nAll\n courses enrolled and completed, courses recognized, automatically \nrecorded or transferred are listed in the diploma supplement together \nwith credits gained or recognized (the diploma supplement under Section \n57(1)(f) of the Act is issued separately for each of the successfully \ncompleted studies). If the studies were not successfully completed, the \ncourses enrolled and completed, courses recognized, automatically \nrecorded or transferred are listed in the transcript of records, which \nis issued by the Office for Studies together with the certificate of \nstudy pursuant to Section 57(5) of the Act.\n\n\n(6) Credits gained for courses identical or substantially overlapping\n with courses for which the student has already gained credits in these \nstudies shall not be recognized and included in the credit value.\n\n\nExplanation\nIt\n is not permissible to accumulate credits for courses with identical \ncontents. The restriction of the student\u2019s right to register and enrol \nin such courses is achieved through the so-called prerequisites. An IS \nMU application does not allow enrolment in course X if it is encoded in \nits prerequisites that enrolment in course X is prevented by the \ncompletion of course Y in the past.\n\n\n(7) At the request of a student, the dean is entitled to decide on a \nrepeated completion of a course provided its content significantly \ndiffers during each implementation of the course. In such case, the \nrepeated completion is not considered course repetition under Section \n20.\n\n\nExplanation\nA typical example is a PE course.",

Direct \nteaching means the face-to-face teaching or synchronous online teaching \nor a combination thereof.\n\n\nExplanation\nDirect\n teaching in the full-time study mode is primarily carried out face to \nface; in justified cases specified by MU methodology, it may be replaced\n by synchronous online teaching. Studies in the full time mode may also \ninclude asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study. The use of remote\n teaching activities in the full-time study mode is regulated by Section\n 22 of MU Directive No. 1/2024.\n\n\nThe teaching in the distance study mode is delivered mainly through \nasynchronous methods, i.e. guided self-study. Distance study mode may \nalso include direct teaching delivered face to face or through \nsynchronous online methods. The scope and proportion of asynchronous and\n direct teaching and the method of communication with the teacher, as \nwell as between the students themselves, is defined during the process \nof degree programme accreditation.\n\n\nThe teaching in the combined study mode is delivered through the \ncombination of direct and asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study.\n The proportion of face-to-face teaching and synchronous online teaching\n is defined during the process of degree programme accreditation. \nBachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree programmes in the combined study mode \ninclude at least 80 lessons of direct teaching per semester, except for \nthe last semester of studies, in which focus is on writing the final \nthesis if mandatory in the degree programme.\n\n\n(3)\tFull-time students are required to participate in the instruction\n with the exception of lectures and consultations.

                "answer": "(1)\t\nThe right to participate in a course and in other study-related \nactivities necessary for its completion arises to a student solely \nthrough the course enrolment.\n\n\n(2)\tIn the period for course registration and subsequently in the \nperiod for course enrolment, a student, via the IS MU, chooses the \ncourses planned to be attended in the next semester. Course enrolment \nshall be carried out unless prevented by an obstacle under these \nRegulations.\n\n\nExplanation\nDepending\n on the programme, the student may be obliged in the first semesters of \nstudies to enrol in certain courses in accordance with the recommended \nstudy plan. Enrolment in a course is only valid if confirmed by the \nrelevant IS MU application. Course enrolment is automatically confirmed \non a daily basis, however, at the latest on the first day after the end \nof the period for enrolment as determined by the academic year schedule.\nThe semester schedule sets the period for registration, period for \nenrolment and period for changing enrolment in courses. The student is \nallowed to choose (register) and cancel (deregister) courses during all \nthe three periods. When choosing the courses, the student will search \nfor course codes or use the offer in the template. Any course scheduled \nfor the given semester at any MU faculty may be registered. Course \nregistration takes place at different times at various faculties, \naccording to the faculty semester schedule. In case the student meets \nthe conditions described in the Course Catalogue, the course \nregistration will be smooth (marked in white), in the opposite case, it \nwill be marked in red. During the period of enrolment and enrolment \nchanges, problem-free courses are confirmed, i.e. the student is \nenrolled, each night (all changes typically take place before the start \nof the semester and in the first two weeks of the semester). By \nenrolment in a course, the student becomes entitled and obliged to study\n that course.\n\n\nThe IS MU will enrol (confirm) courses only for active studies (e.g. \nthose that have not been interrupted). The student may, however, \nregister courses also if the studies have been interrupted. The Office \nfor Studies may both register and enrol courses regardless of whether \nthe studies are active or not.\n\n\nThe student may choose (register/enrol) only courses scheduled for \nthe period of the academic year to which the student registers/enrols. \nThe student may not register/enrol a course to the spring semester if \nsuch a course is only taught in autumn semesters.\n\n\n(3)\tA student is entitled to register and enrol in courses whose \ncredit value does not exceed 60 credits in one semester for each of the \nstudent\u2019s studies.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n registration of courses for a given semester in the IS MU is an \nexpression of the student\u2019s wish to take and complete the courses in the\n given semester. Early registration allows the student to be guaranteed a\n \u201cplace\u201d in courses that are limited in capacity and can be expected to \nbe in high demand. Information about the number of students who will be \ncompleting courses in the examination period of a given semester or \nattending classes during the semester is displayed to the teacher in the\n IS MU Teacher\u2019s Notebook. After the registration, timetables of classes\n are prepared. The student may apply for enrolment in courses in the \nperiod for enrolment. In case the capacity of the course has been \nexceeded, the student cannot take the course in the given semester.\n\n\n(4)\tFor the purpose of preparing the timetable or an offer of \ncourses, the dean is entitled to decide on the obligation to register a \ncourse before the period for course registration and enrolment; this \ndoes not apply to registration immediately following enrolment or \nre-enrolment in studies.\n\n\nExplanation\nIn\n the event that not enough students have registered a course, it may \nhappen that the course will not be taught. The registration duty does \nnot apply to students who enrol in courses in the first semester of \ntheir studies and students who enrol in courses immediately after \nre-enrolment in studies following an interruption.\n\n\n(5)\tThe dean is entitled to limit the number of students enrolled in a\n course. In such case, the guidelines for prioritization of students are\n set, giving preference to students for whom the course is compulsory, \nselective or repeated (Section 20) and those who have registered the \ncourse.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n starting date of course registration for a certain group of students is\n defined by so-called registration waves. Registration waves only start \non working days. The beginning of the registration is distributed into \nfive waves, in which growing numbers of students may register.\nThe \u201cremaining credit volume\u201d is used to determine the order in which \nindividual groups of students may register. This is the number of \ncredits the student has to gain to reach the total required for the \ncompletion of their studies within a programme. The remaining credit \nvolume is the difference between the minimum credit value of the studies\n (i.e. the standard duration of study in semesters multiplied by 30) and\n the number of credits gained so far that have been included in the \ntotal of the programme studied, including credits for recognized courses\n (if the result is negative, it is treated as zero).\n\n\nThe first registration wave: from the moment of the beginning of \nregistration at a given faculty, those students whose remaining credit \nvolume is lower than 61, plus all doctoral students are allowed to \nregister.\n\n\nThe second registration wave: from the moment following two working \ndays after the beginning of the registration, those students whose \nremaining credit volume is lower than 121 are also allowed to register.\n\n\nThe third registration wave: from the moment following four working \ndays after the beginning of the registration, those students whose \nremaining credit volume is lower than 181 are also allowed to register.\n\n\nThe fourth registration wave: from the moment following six working \ndays after the beginning of the registration, those students whose \nremaining credit volume is lower than 241 are also allowed to register.\n\n\nThe fifth registration wave: from the moment following eight working \ndays after the beginning of the registration, all students will \nregister.\n\n\nIn case a student is enrolled in concurrent studies, the remaining \ncredit volume is calculated separately for each of the studies; the \nstudent also registers courses separately in each of the studies.\n\n\nThe numbers of credits gained are usually calculated at night. \nHowever, if the student was given assessment immediately before the \nstart of a registration wave and they need the credits to be admitted to\n the registration wave, the student may use the application for \nrecalculating the credits.\n\n\n(6)\tFurther conditions for enrolment in registered courses including \nthe requirement of prior completion of other courses may be determined \nin the programme specification or the Course Catalogue, as the case may \nbe.\n\n\n(7)\tChanges in course enrolment are only possible during the period \ndesignated for course enrolment and its change; this does not apply to \nenrolment in intensive or specially scheduled courses; special \nguidelines for such courses are set by the dean.\n\n\nExplanation\nThis right only arises when enrolment in the next semester is confirmed (Section 12).\n\n\nThe rules on which course enrolment depends are called prerequisites.\n They define study obligations to be fulfilled for the student to be \nenrolled in a course. The student cannot enrol in a course unless these \nprerequisites have been met. If the student meets the prerequisites for \nenrolment in a course in one study and has the course registered or \nenrolled without any problems, they automatically meet the prerequisites\n in all their other studies. A typical prerequisite is the successful \ncompletion of a course whose content is necessary for mastering the \ncourse to be registered. Other prerequisites include the obligation of \nsimultaneous enrolment in certain courses (for example, the prohibition \nof enrolment in a course taught in the form of lectures and completed by\n examination without simultaneous enrolment in a corresponding course \ntaught in the form of seminars and completed by fulfilling the \nrequirements); prohibition of enrolment in a course if a course of the \nsame content has already been completed or recognized, prohibition of \nsimultaneous enrolment in courses of the same content; prohibition of \nenrolment in a course if a prescribed number of credits has not been \nachieved, etc. Where a prerequisite \u201capproval\u201d is present, an explicit \napproval by the teacher is required (through granting an exemption).\n\n\nA prerequisite concerning university-wide PE courses is a prohibition\n to enrol in PE courses by students in bachelor\u2019s and master's \nprogrammes who have already successfully completed two semester-long PE \ncourses (students of the mentioned programmes are entitled to take two \nsemesters of PE, students of follow-up master\u2019s programmes are not \nentitled to enrol in PE courses); two PE courses cannot be taken \nconcurrently.\n\n\n(8)\tPrior to the beginning of the registration period, the dean is \nentitled to determine a minimum number of students enrolled in a course;\n in case such number is not enrolled in the course, the dean is entitled\n to cancel the teaching in the course unless the course is compulsory \n(Section 8(3)(a)). In such case, an enrolled student has the right to \nadditionally enrol in courses with a similar credit value.\n\n\nExplanation\nAt\n any time during the period of course registration, course enrolment and\n the period for changes in course enrolment, the student is allowed to \nmake changes to their application for course enrolment in a given \nsemester. Courses may be added or cancelled in the electronic \napplication.\n\n\nIn the period for course enrolment and changes in course enrolment \nduring which enrolment is being confirmed, the student is allowed to \nmake changes to the enrolment that has already been confirmed. Any \nchanges end as per midnight of the last day of the period for course \nenrolment. The student is obliged to duly study the courses in which \nthey enrolled.\n\n\nCourses with a different mode of enrolment must be specified in the \nIS MU. This applies to intensive and specially scheduled courses.\n\n\nSuccessful enrolment in courses of the following semester (confirmed \nenrolment) means that the student will be able to study and complete \nthese courses provided the student has the right to enrol in the next \nsemester (Section 12).",

In case the student meets the conditions \nmentioned in this subsection, the dean will grant the request. If the \nconditions have not been met, the dean will assess the request and \nprovide reasons for their decision. There is no entitlement to a \nfavourable decision. If studies are to be interrupted, the dean \nexplicitly sets the start date and the end date of the interruption.\n\n\nThe conditions of Section 12(1) and (2) do not apply to students who \nhave fulfilled the study plan within the meaning of Section 23(1) or \nSection 24(4).\n\n\n(2)\tA request for interruption of studies due to serious reasons \nshall be decided by the dean after assessing the reasons stated in the \nrequest; in order to assess a request for interruption of studies in a \ndoctoral programme, the dean is entitled to ask the doctoral board for \nopinion.\n\n\nExplanation\nSerious reasons  \u2013 permanent necessary care for a close person, death in the family, etc.\n\n\nSerious health reasons form a specific subgroup, which may consist of\n a long-term serious illness of the student, associated in addition with\n hospitalisation, as well as cases of sudden outbreaks of illness during\n studies with the need for time to stabilise the condition or cases of \nperiodic recurrences and relapses (not serious in individual cases, but \nin aggregate warranting consideration as serious reasons). The decision \nto interrupt the studies for serious or ordinary reasons has a major \nimpact on the calculation of the duration of studies; it is therefore \nadvisable to seek the expert opinion of the Teiresias Centre in the case\n of requests for interruptions for serious reasons, mainly within the \nsubgroup of medical conditions.\n\n\n(3)\tIn the decision on interruption of studies, the dean shall set \nthe beginning and end dates of the interruption period; the dean is \nentitled to determine further conditions for enrolment in the semester \nimmediately following re-enrolment in studies.

                "answer": "(1)\tThe dean is entitled to recognize a course completed:\n\n\nin previous or concurrent studies at MU,\n\t\nin previous or concurrent studies at another higher education institution in the Czech Republic or abroad,\n\t\nin previous or concurrent studies in an accredited educational\n programme at a tertiary vocational school in the Czech Republic or \nabroad,\n\t\nin previous or concurrent studies in lifelong learning up to \n60% of the minimum credit value of studies for which the courses are \nrecognized.\n\n\nPrevious studies for the purposes of this section mean studies completed under Section 55 or 56 of the Act.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n dean may choose not to recognize a course. One of the preconditions for\n recognition is the concordance of contents of the courses.\n\n\nNam\u00edsto p\u0159edm\u011btu X lze \u017e\u00e1dat o uzn\u00e1n\u00ed p\u0159edm\u011btu obsahov\u011b shodn\u00e9ho, Y. \nObsahov\u00e1 shoda p\u0159edm\u011bt\u016f je bu\u010f definov\u00e1na studijn\u00edm programem, nebo o n\u00ed\n rozhodne garant studijn\u00edho programu.\n\n\nInstead of course X, the student may apply for recognition of course Y\n whose content is equal. The concordance of content is defined by the \ndegree programme or is decided by the degree programme guarantor.\nRecognition of the final state examination, advanced master\u2019s state \nexamination in Medicine, doctoral state examination, individual parts of\n these examinations, doctoral thesis defence from previous studies or \nfrom a concurrent study at another HE institution is inadmissible.\n\n\n(2)\tA course that is compulsory or selective may be recognized under \nsubsection 1 in the relevant studies. The dean may specify other courses\n that can be recognized, except for courses mentioned in Section 8(4).\n\n\n(3)\t\tThe dean may also recognize a set of courses instead of a course or a group of courses prescribed for the studies.\n\n\n(4)\tA request for the recognition of parts of studies completed outside of MU submitted by a student must include:\n\n\na full transcript of records, i.e. an official \ncertificate of completion of each course including grades, credits and \nnumber of failed course completion attempts, and\n\t\nan official transcript of the course syllabus including a description of the course\u2019s place in the relevant programme.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n student does not need to submit documents concerning recognized courses\n that are available to the Office for Studies in the IS MU.\n\n\n(5)\tThe dean is entitled to require that the course be recognized by \npassing an equivalency examination or meet other equivalency \nrequirements; in such case, the dean shall determine an examiner or a \nmethod of equivalency requirements fulfilment. For recognition purposes,\n the original assessment of the course is substituted with an assessment\n of the equivalency examination or a result of equivalency requirements \nfulfilment.\n\n\nExplanation\nIf,\n for example, the equivalency examination is assessed with a C grade, \nwhereas the original grading of the course to be recognized was A, the \nnew, C grade is entered in the records.\n\n\n(6)\tThe assessment and a record of the number of failed course \ncompletion attempts are recognized along with the course completion. If \nthe recognized course was not assessed with credits, its credit value is\n determined in line with the rules applicable to the relevant studies.\n\n\nExplanation\nIf a course is recognized without an equivalency examination or requirements, its original grading is entered in the records.\n\n\n(7)\tThe completion of courses or a set of courses from previous duly \ncompleted studies may be recognized with credits in the aggregate amount\n by which the number of credits gained in previous studies exceeds \nthirty times the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the \nnumber of semesters.\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n provision of Section 14(7) does not constitute an entitlement to \nrecognition with credits. The recognition is decided on by the dean (or \nan authorized vice-dean) based on the student\u2019s request.\n\n\nThe provision of Section 14(7) concerns in particular those students \nwho study in a follow-up master\u2019s programme and in the previous duly \ncompleted bachelor\u2019s programme gained more credits than the minimum \nvalue. These \u201csurplus\u201d credits may be transferred to the follow-up \nprogramme upon a request for recognition. However, both of the following\n requirements must be fulfilled when the provision is applied.\n\n\nThe requirement of Section 14(1) under which only those courses may \nbe recognized (with or without credits) that are compulsory or selective\n in relation to the studies for which they are recognized, and, as the \ncase may be, other courses determined by the dean. The provision of \nSection 6(4) defines the minimum credit value of the studies. Only the \nnumber of credits gained by the student in the previous studies \nexceeding the minimum credit value of these previous studies may be \ntransferred to the subsequent (e.g. follow-up master\u2019s) studies.\n\n\nExample 1:\n The minimum credit value of studies in \nthe bachelor\u2019s programme is 180 credits. The student completed the \nstudies within the standard duration and as part of the studies \ncompleted courses X (6 credits), Y (8 credits) and Z (4 credits), which \nare prescribed as compulsory in the follow-up master\u2019s programme. Thus \nthe student gained 190 credits in the bachelor\u2019s studies. The student \ncan have all the three courses recognized to the follow-up master\u2019s \nprogramme. However, only 10 credits will be transferred to the minimum \ncredit value of the master\u2019s programme (not 18, which was the real value\n of the courses).\n\n\nExample 2:\n The minimum credit value of studies in \nthe bachelor\u2019s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the \nstudies after 7 semesters (he studied one semester longer than the \nstandard duration) and gained 200 credits. This number does not exceed \nthe value of 7 x 30 = 210, prescribed by Section 14(7). No credits can \nbe transferred to the follow-up master\u2019s studies. However, if the \nstudent completed some courses which are compulsory or selective for the\n follow-up master\u2019s studies in which he is enrolled, such courses may be\n recognized without credits.\n\n\nExample 3:\n The minimum credit value of studies in \nthe bachelor\u2019s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the \nstudies after 5 semesters (one semester less than the standard duration)\n and gained 200 credits. With reference to Section 14(7), the student \nrequests the transfer of courses worth (200\u20135 x 30) = 50 credits to the \nfollow-up master\u2019s studies. However, courses worth 50 credits cannot be \nrecognized even if they were compulsory or selective courses, because \nafter the deduction, the credit value attributable previous bachelor\u2019s \nstudies would decrease to 200\u201350 = 150 credits, which is below the \nminimum credit value of the studies. Therefore, only 20 credits may be \nrecognized; potential further courses may be recognized without credits.\n\n\nThe provision of Section 14(7) also applies to students who duly \ncompleted any studies and wish to have certain courses recognized to \nsubsequent studies. If, for example, the student has a bachelor\u2019s \ndiploma in Mathematics and his further studies will be the bachelor\u2019s \nprogramme in Physics, all the courses in maths can be recognized in the \nsubsequent studies from the point of content. However, in case he gained\n the minimum credit value (180 credits) in his bachelor\u2019s studies of \nmaths, the courses will be recognized with zero credit value. In fact it\n means that the student cannot get another diploma for courses \nrecognized on the grounds of content similarity. He must achieve the \nminimum credit value of the studies again.\n\n\nThis situation differs from concurrent studies, where credits may be gained concurrently.\n\n\nIf subjects with a credit value were recognized or recorded for the \nstudent in the course of study that was terminated in accordance with \u00a7 \n55 of the Act from a previous study, then the amount of these credits \nmust be deducted from the total amount of credits in the course of study\n that was terminated in accordance with \u00a7 55 of the Act exceed thirty \ntimes the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the number of \nsemesters, and that is if it would be possible to recognize credits, \nwhich in aggregate amount exceed thirty times the duration of duly \ncompleted studies expressed in the number of semesters, for the purposes\n of further study.\n\n\n(8)\tThe aggregate amount of credits recognized in accordance with \nsubsection 1 is excluded from the number of credits used for assessing \nthe fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in the next semester under \nSection 12(2)(a), (b) and (d); however, it is included in the number of \ncredits used for assessing whether minimum credit value was reached as \nwell as for assessing the fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in \nthe next semester according to Section 12(2)(c).\n\n\nExplanation\nThe\n credit value of recognized courses is not relevant for the assessment \nof the right to enrol in the next semester under Section 12(2)(a), (b) \nand (d).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the credit value of courses recognized from \nprevious studies is included into the minimum credit value of the \nstudies for which these courses were recognized with credits, which also\n includes the assessment whether the student has the right to enrol in \nthe next semester under Section 12(2)(c).\n\n\n(9)\tNo part of the final state examination, doctoral state \nexamination or, in the fields of General Medicine and Dentistry, the \nadvanced master\u2019s state examination can be recognized from previous or \nconcurrent studies.\n\n\n(10)\tFor the purposes of assessing the fulfilment of the requirements\n for study, all compulsory and selective courses (Section 8(3)) \ncompleted at MU during the course of previous unsuccessful studies, \nincluding their credit value, are automatically included, as long as the\n duration of the period between their completion and enrolment in a \ngiven studies does not exceed three years.\n\n\n(11)\tThe transfer of courses completed as part of foreign mobility programmes is governed by an MU directive.\n\n\nExplanation\nStudents\n are obliged to register their stay abroad in an IS MU application. The \nrequisites of registration of a stay abroad before its beginning and \nafter its end are set out in the Guidelines issued by the Centre for \nInternational Cooperation.\n\n\nIf the outcomes of a stay abroad are transferred by MU into the \nstudies, the student is obliged to promptly register in the IS MU the \ndocuments prescribed by the CIC Guidelines. The outcomes from a stay \nabroad are transferred into the semester in which the student \nstayed abroad.\n\n\n((12)\tAfter returning from study abroad, at the request of the \nstudent and according to the possibilities of the degree programme, the \nrequirements for fulfilling the study obligations shall be adjusted in \norder to limit the necessity of prolonging the studies.",

The number of repeaters\nincludes students who have registered for a course with a bad time\nstamp; this grade will automatically improve during the night.\n\n\nIn addition, priority is given to students who are actively\nstudying one of the \"the fields the course is directly associated\nwith\".

To find out how many applicants do and do not have priority, see the \"Numbers\" section.\n\nLast in the list are those students who are not studying the \nfields the course is directly associated with and are not repeating the \ncourse.\n\n\n\nInactive (e.g. interrupted) studies and studies with already awarded \ngrades (e.g. recognised courses) are not included in the calculation.\n\n\nWithin these groups, the order is according to the time stamp assigned \nat registration. You can find your stamps under the \"More information\" \nlink. If more than one record has the same timestamp, they are further\nsorted according to the record's internal identification in the\nsystem. For example, the time stamp is followed by 16/25, which means \nthat it is the 16th of 25 time stamps created in that second.\n\n\nIf a student registers for the same course in more than one of his/her \nstudies, the system will search for the course and change the time\nstamp to the best stamp found in all the registrations of that\nstudent. The change will not take effect until 24 hours following the \nregistration of the course.\n\n\n\nHow can the achieved ranking change?\n\n\nIf the fields the course is directly associated with in the\ncatalogue change, a different number of students will be given\npriority.\n\nRepeat students will appear in the ranking (before the \nenrollment period begins) and will be automatically registered by the \nsystem.\n\nStudents with previously interrupted studies who were able to\nregister but whose ranking has not yet entered the calculation will be registered.\n\nThe office for studies will enrol a certain number of students\noutside the normal registration.\n\nA reduction in rank may occur if someone placed ahead of you\nunregisters because they no longer need to repeat the course or\nfinished (interrupts) their studies.

You can only be exempt from\ncourse-repetition if the sum of the credit values does not exceed 10% of the minimum credit value of the study.\n\nFor the calculation of the minimum credit value of studies, the\nstandard period of study of the field of study is used, namely the\nlongest period of actively studied fields of study (if the student is \nactively studying more than one field of study). For one semester, 30 \ncredits are counted towards the minimum credit value of studies.\n\n\nThe distinction between compulsory and optional courses is not yet\nimplemented in the system. Therefore, it is possible to submit a\nrequest for cancellation of the obligation to repeat even for courses\nthat are compulsory for you.

Include in the letter the reasons why the \nteacher should grant you an exception or permission to enroll. To submit\n the request, click the \"Apply for permission and send email\" button.\nYou can withdraw the pending request again at the same\nlocation. The application will send an email to the teacher (or course \nguarantor or contact person, depending on who is responsible for \nhandling exceptions).\nIf the change is such that your original red registration is white (the \nproblem has been resolved), the teacher sees that it is unnecessary to \nconsider the exception request.

                "answer": "The\n following shows how to work with the Study Planner. This tutorial will \nbe divided into several chapters - adding a semester, finding and adding\n courses, adding courses to semesters, and saving a plan.\n        \n\n\nAdding a semester\n\n\nThe first step a student has to take when creating a plan for\n his / her studies is to create the appropriate semesters that the \nstudent wants to plan. By default, there are several empty semesters in \nthe application that match the standard length of the study. To create a\n new (next) semester, the student must click the + Add Semester button. \nThis is located in the lower left corner of the Plan section (see \nscreenshot in the previous question).\n\n\nWith the + Add Semester button, a student can add a number of\n semesters to plan. The default is to always add a semester following \nthe last semester in the curriculum. If the student does not want to \nplan the next semester (eg if the student plans to interrupt studies for\n the given semester), he / she can change the semester to the required \nsemester. This can be achieved by clicking on the pencil icon (change \nthe study period) next to the name of the semester. Then a window will \nappear in which you can change the study period to the desired future \nsemester. In case the student wants to combine 2 scheduled semesters \ninto one, the procedure is as follows. First of all, the student chooses\n a semester whose content he wants to add to another semester. For this \nsemester, he clicks again on the pencil icon next to the semester name. \nIn a new window, he then selects the appropriate semester with which he \nwants to merge the current semester.\n\n\nSearch for courses\n\n\nAnother important step in the planning of studies is to find \nindividual courses that the student is interested in and save them for \nlater insertion into individual semesters. There are two basic ways to \nfind semesters in the Study Planner.\n\n\nSearch for courses in the Course Catalog\n\n\nThe student can access the search using the Course Catalog \nby clicking on the Add Course button at the top of the right panel. \nClicking this button opens a window with the Course Catalog. In the \nCatalog, a student can select a number of attributes to filter out the \nitems that are displayed to him / her (eg by faculty and workplace, \nPeriod, Template or using the search window). After selecting the \nfilters, the student must click the View button at the top of the window\n next to the search box. You will then see all the courses that match \nthose filters. To select individual courses that the student wants to \nadd to their plan, it is necessary to tick the checkboxes for each \nrelevant course. A separate help for searching in the Course Catalog can\n be found \nin the relevant help.\n.\n\n\nAfter selecting the first course, a new bar will appear \nwith information on the number of selected courses with three buttons. \nThe first button from the left is the Show button, which displays a new \nwindow with all courses in the current selection and allows you to \ndeselect some courses or deselect all courses. The middle Cancel button \nallows you to cancel the entire selection. The last button Go to the \napplication, then serves to return to the Study Planner and the selected\n courses will be transferred to the Saved courses section in the right \npanel (see chapter \nAdding a course to the semester\n).\n\n\nIn Control Templates\n\n\nThe second way a student can look for courses and add them \nto their study plan is to use Control Templates. These can be accessed \nby clicking on the Template Check button located in the right panel at \nthe top. After clicking this button, the student will see a window with \nthree tabs - Study Control Templates, Other Control Templates and \nRegistration Templates. By default, the Student Control Templates tab \nappears. Here the student will find all the subjects that are linked to \nhis / her currently chosen study. The courses are categorized \nhierarchically (typically Compulsory Courses, Compulsory Elective \nCourses or sets of courses according to possible study specializations).\n Students can open individual categories and choose from a range of \ncourses. For more information, the student can click through (more) in \nthe relevant course field. This function displays basic information for \nthe course, such as the name of the faculty at which the course is \ntaught, the way of completion, the language of instruction and the \nnumber of credits. For even more information about the course, the \nstudent can click on the course name, which will open the course \nsyllabus in the Course Catalog. To add a course to the study plan, the \nstudent must click the button in the relevant course field. This button \ninserts the subject into Saved Courses (see Question \nAdding a Course to the Semester\n).\n\n\n\n\nInserting courses into semesters\n\n\nAfter selecting and saving courses in the study plan, all \nselected courses are saved in the Saved Courses section, located in the \nright panel. Saved courses always contain parentheses with a number \nrepresenting the number of courses currently saved. Thus, this function \nacts as a certain stack of selected courses that the student can insert \ninto individual semesters of the plan. If the student does not see all \nof the courses in the Saved Courses stack, you need to click the down \narrow icon that appears after Saved Courses to expand the menu with all \nof the courses saved so far.\n\n\n\n         To add a course to a semester, you need to drag the course from\n the saved courses menu and paste it into the appropriate semester. \nAfter inserting the course in the semester, the course will be deleted \nfrom the saved courses. Newly, however, the course (in the upper right \ncorner of the course) in the given semester may display a number of \nicons that signal further information about the course status (whether \nit is enrolled, completed, etc.) whether it conflicts with the planned \nstudy (eg whether there are any other problems with the possible \nregistration (or enrollment) of the course (eg the course is not \nenrolled in the given semester). After inserting the courses into the \nsemester, it is always advisable to save the curriculum, otherwise it \nmay be lost (see \nSaving the curriculum\n).\n\n\nOverview of course status icons and their meaning:\n\n\n\n         The course has been successfully completed\n\n\n\n         The course was unsuccessfully terminated\n\n\n\n          The course is scheduled\n\n\n\n         The course is registered\n\n\n\n         The course is enrolled\n\n\n\n         Repeated course\n\n\n\n         The course can not be repeated\n\n\n\n         The course is offered in the given semester\n\n\n\n          The course is not offered for the term\n\n\n\n         Unfulfilled prerequisites for entering the course\n\n\nRemoving the course from the semester and removing the semesters\n\n\nIf a student wants to remove a course from a given semester \nor from the Saved Courses section, drag the course to the Trash icon. \nThis is located in the right panel, in the same section as Saved \nCourses.\n\n\nIf the student wants to remove the entire scheduled semester,\n it is necessary to remove all courses from the given semester in the \nfirst step. After the scheduled semester empty, you need a plan to save \nagain, leading to its deletion from the plan.\n\n\n\n\nSave study plan\n\n\nAfter planning the study, or any part of it (removing courses\n or semesters, saving selected courses, etc.), it is necessary to save \nthe study plan. To save, click the Save icon at the top of the right \npanel. If a student fails to do so and leaves the Study Planner, student\n loses the entire unsaved study plan.\n\n\nChecking the conditions for the next semester\n\n\nWhen creating a plan and entering courses into individual \nsemesters, the student also shows whether he / she has fulfilled \nsufficient conditions for progress to the next semester. The student can\n see this clearly in the field, which indicates the number of credits in\n the scheduled semester. If the icon containing the number of credits \nscheduled for a given semester is green, the students' plan is \nsufficient to advance to the next semester. Conversely, if the icon is \ncolored red, the plan is insufficient and the student does not fulfill \nthe conditions for progress to the next semester and should adjust their\n curriculum. If the icon is red (indicating that it is impossible to \nadvance to the next semester), the student can click on it. Then he / \nshe will see a new window in which he / she will have an overview of all\n the conditions for moving to the next semester and evaluating why in \nthis particular semester his plan does not meet these conditions.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Checking the conditions for the next semest.\n\n",

After clicking this button, students will\n see a window with three tabs - Study Control Templates, Other Control \nTemplates, and Registration Templates. By default, students will see the\n Study Control Templates tab. Here the student will find all the courses\n that are linked to his / her currently selected study. Another option \nis to use the Other Control Templates tab, by means of which the student\n can compare his / her study with Control Templates of other fields. The\n courses are divided into a tree structure (typically Compulsory \nCourses, Compulsory Elective Courses or sets of courses according to \npossible study specializations). The individual levels and parts of the \nControl template are then marked with a color bar on the left side of \nthe respective level.

Students can use the \nControl Template to find out which compulsory parts of their studies \nhave already been fulfilled and which courses they have to successfully \ncomplete. It is also possible to add the courses to the curriculum using\n the Control Template function (see Inserting courses into semesters).\n\n\nWarning\nControl\n templates may not always match the real study requirements. Please take\n control of your study using the Control Templates with reserve. The \nfinal decision to meet all study requirements is always within the \ncompetence of your study department.",

                "answer": "The\n evaluator has the option to set any indicators he wants to find out \nabout the workers. The indicator can be both the number of hours taught,\n organized training sessions, scientific publications written, as well \nas the evaluation of the teacher by students or anything else that the \nevaluator deems relevant.\n\n\nA set of 24 indicators is automatically assigned to each newly \ncreated period, which can be modified as desired, or deleted and \nreplaced by others. The exception is the periods for workplace \nevaluation with non-academic staff. No indicator is automatically \nassigned to such periods, and the evaluator must choose all indicators \nhimself.\n\n\nWhen editing indicators, EVAK automatically offers a list of all \nindicators introduced in the application. For easier manipulation, the \nlist can be filtered by checking one or more limiting criteria. Then \nonly those indicators that match at least one ticked label will be \ndisplayed. If the user does not find an indicator that meets his \nrequirements among the established indicators, he can add his own \nindicator using the \"Create your own indicator\" field at the bottom of \nthe page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n A comment can be added to each indicator.\n\n\n\n\nFor all indicators for which the value is generated automatically\n by the IS (for example, the indicator \"Number of subjects including a \nworker\"), employees can also enter their own value if they do not agree \nwith the automatically generated one. For all indicators, there is \nalways a field for adding your own comment.\n\n\nIf it is necessary to add a more detailed label or instruction to the\n centrally set indicator, the \"Optional comment on the indicator\" field \ncan be used. He will then see this comment evaluated in his record \ndirectly under the name of the given indicator.\n\n\nIndicator values are calculated based on current data in the IS MU. \nHowever, in order to be able to trace in the future which number the \nevaluated employee commented on in the form, all values are remembered \nafter the first saving of the evaluation form (even continuous saving is\n sufficient, it does not have to be a closure).

It is possible to change the group in which it \nwill be displayed. It is also possible to adjust the order in which the \nindicators will be displayed in the evaluation form.

                "answer": "Yes, you can. The weights for the indicators can only be set before the start of the period. A typical procedure is as follows:\n\nThe employee establishes the employee evaluation period,\n\nassigns a list of indicators to the given period,\n\nthen assigns weights to the assigned indicators.\n\n\nThe weight assigns a higher importance to the selected indicators for \nauxiliary point evaluation of the performance of employees. Individual \nemployees do not have access to the auxiliary point evaluation, and it \nis not reflected in their final evaluation report. It is therefore \ninformation intended only for the evaluator.\n\n\nWeights are set for a period that already has a list of indicators assigned, via the function:\n\n\nThe Information system \n Managerial data  \n (EVAK) \n EVAK - Vytvo\u0159en\u00ed/\u00faprava etapy hodnocen\u00ed pracovn\u00edk\u016f \n Na\u010d\u00edst nebo zkop\u00edrovat existuj\u00edc\u00ed etapu \n\nEditovat (vybranou etapu) \n (Dal\u0161\u00ed aplikace) \n Stanoven\u00ed vah indik\u00e1tor\u016f\n\n\nThe application offers several pre-set indicator weights (taking \ninto account the number of hours, taking into account the job position, \ntaking into account a non-zero value of the indicator, etc.).

                "answer": "The hunting for places in queue agenda allows you to determine the order of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who register for a given event - called a time contest. A time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition can be a competition for theatre tickets, registration for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlucrative course, or limiting any offer in the Shopping Centre. Those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterested in a given event are selected only on the basis of the time registration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinciple without any other criteria. The order of the applicants is\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttherefore\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdetermined only by the time of clicking on the button to obtain the code.\n\n\nRegular sales in the Shopping Centre or other registration methods in the\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMU IS are not usually adapted for timed competitions. However,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe agenda of time competitions, built on the simple principle of a click\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition, allows the system to serve hundreds, thousands or even tens of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthousands of applicants in a very short interval.",

                "answer": "The time contest agenda introduces electronic registration for the contest in three phases: \n\t\t\t\t\t\nPhase 1: obtaining the competition code\n\n\nIn the first phase, the entrant receives a ten-character random code free of charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat \nhttps://souteze.is.muni.cz/\n, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetermines their ranking in the competition. This is the stage where the competition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\titself takes place, depending on when the code was generated.\n\n\nEach code has a time stamp recorded on it, to 6 decimal places of a second,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding to the moment the user clicks on the button to obtain the code.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis time stamp is therefore used to determine the order. The application will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot allow any code to be generated for a given contest until the contest has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted.\n\n\nPhase 2: registration of the competition code\n\n\nIn the second phase, the contest code obtained must be registered at \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/souteze/registrace.pl\n.\n\n\nBy registering, the user both confirms his/her interest in participating in the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition and also finds out whether his/her code is successful. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA successful code is one whose ranking is lower than the set capacity of the event. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegistration for the competition takes place on an individual basis over a 24-hour period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTherefore, it does not matter when the contestant confirms the registration within the set 24 hours.\n\n\nAn unsuccessful contestant has the option to return to the application within the validity \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval of their code, re-enter the code and test whether the ranking has changed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the event of a vacancy, the code holder will be notified by email. However, the system \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill only send an email for the first code released in this way.\n\n\nPhase 3: processing of the competition code\n\n\nAfter a successful registration phase, the participant is \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nentitled to to collect the prize in a timed competition typically 14 days\n. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring this period, for example, he/she must pick up tickets or pay for the service in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion at the Shopping Centre. When making a purchase, the participant presents the competition code.\n\n\nIf the competition code is not used within the time limit, the code becomes invalid \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the capacity becomes available for other entrants, who are automatically notified \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby email and thus become eligible to register again under Phase 2.\n\n\nThe competition ends when all codes meeting capacity have been processed or the competition \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend date has been entered. Available capacity is offered on a rolling basis according to interest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf there is sufficient capacity, codes generated several days after the start of the competition may \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso be eligible.

                "answer": "Evaluation in EVAK takes place in several steps:\n\n\nThe evaluator creates a new evaluation period and assigns employees to it.\n\n  The evaluation period can be established either for a specific \nworkplace or as a so-called central evaluation period for the evaluation\n of several workplaces.\n  \nThe evaluator adds and edits the indicators (criteria) used for employee evaluation.\n\n  The application offers dozens of indicators from the field of \npedagogy, scientific research, organizational activity and the field of \npersonal competences. The evaluator can choose which indicators he wants\n to use, or add his own indicators. The weight with which it should be \nincluded in the overall evaluation of the employee can be set for each \nindicator.\n  \nEvaluation employees fill in the required data in the application.\n\n  Employees are notified of the start of evaluation period collection \n(by automated email or other means) and are required to complete and \ncheck individual indicators.  Some indicators (for example, the number \nof hours taught) are automatically calculated by the application, others\n must be added manually by an employee who is evaluated.  The employee \nhas the option to add a comment to all indicators. If the automatically \ncalculated value does not correspond to reality, the employee can enter \nhis own value and explain in the comment where the difference occurred.\n  \nThe evaluator adds his comments to the indicators.\n\n  As soon as the employee opens his evaluation, his evaluator can also \nlook at the form, he has space for his comments for each indicator.\n  \nBased on the collected data, an evaluation interview is conducted between the evaluator and the evaluated employee.\n\n  For the interview, the documents collected in EVAK can be printed in PDF format.\n  \nThe conclusions of the evaluation interview are recorded in the written evaluation record.\n\n  After completing all the information, the evaluator will finally close\n the evaluation record. From that moment on, it is no longer possible to\n edit it.\n  \nThe evaluated employee approves the final evaluation record.\n\n  Depending on the setting of the given period, they do so either \nelectronically (the evaluation record is then automatically stored in \nthe employee's electronic file in the file service) or by signing a \nprinted protocol with their own hand (it is then stored in the \nemployee's physical personal file in the relevant personnel department).\n If the employee does not agree with the conclusions, the evaluation is \nforwarded to the head of the economic center for discussion.\n\n\nIndividual steps and evaluation status can be viewed in the EVAK application:\n\n\nThe Information system \n (People)  \n Personal Section \n  Evaluation of academic activities \n [chosen evaluation period] \n current status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n The current status of the employee's evaluation.\n\n\n2\n You can view the entire evaluation process in EVAK.\n\n",

They can also do this through direct access to the EVAK \napplication:\n\n\nThe Information system \n (People)  \n Personal Section \n  Evaluation of academic activities\n\n\nEvaluation in EVAK takes place within the framework of so-called \nperiods. The period is always set to a specific workplace and period:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n By clicking on the name, you can select the period into which the employee can fill in the data for the evaluation.\n\n\n\n\nAfter opening the period, indicators will appear on individual \ntabs divided into four groups (Pedagogy, Science, Organizational, \nPersonal). IS prefills the value for the given indicator if it can be \ngenerated from the system, i.e. it has the source data for its \ncalculation. Next to each automatically calculated value, there is a \n\"Write down\" link, which can be used to expand the details of the \ncalculated data into an indicator. If the worker does not agree with the\n pre-filled value, he has the option to enter his own value, which must \nbe commented on verbally. Indicators that cannot be generated from IS \nare always filled in by the worker.\n\n\nOn the last tab, Final evaluation, there are mandatory items that are\n automatically part of all periods: Evaluation of the worker's \nperformance in the past period and Plan for the next period.\n\n\nThe employee can continuously save his data and comments for the \nevaluation, after completion, it is necessary to save the record with \nthe \"Close the record for editing\" button.\n\n\nUntil the end of the collection of the given period, the record can \nbe reopened and edited, but only if it has not yet been finally closed \nby the manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Individual cards with data, background and comments for evaluation.\n\n\n2\n The employee can add his comment.\n\n",

The person who starts a thread is the \nowner\n.\n  of the thread. The owner clearly defines the topic of discussion in \nthe thread title. In Discussion Forums you are obliged to stick to the \ntopic (so called being on-topic). It is forbidden to make posts with \nlittle informational value (called chatting). \n\n      \n\n      The thread owner \nmay delete posts\n,  that violate \nthe rules described here. The thread owner is the authority who decides \nwhat level of discussion they want to have in the thread. Do not contact\n the system administrator to protest the deletion of a post; if you feel\n restricted, start a competing thread. What discussion is \"proper\" is \nhighly subjective. \n\n      \n\n      The thread owner function is exercised outside the course-related \ndiscussion forums. On a course-related discussion forum, only the course\n teacher may delete an entire thread or sub-thread. \n      \n\n      VDiscussion thread branches automatically disappear after one \nmonth without new posts (does not apply to course-related discussion \nforums).

Contribute primarily in Czech \n(Slovak). Write in English only if there is a reason (e.g. you are \ninserting a copy of the English text). If you post in another language \nfor a compelling reason, include a brief translation into Czech \n(exception \u2013 conversational foreign language threads in course-related \ndiscussion forums). \n\n\n\nDo not post challenges, invitations or advertisements in the discussion forum, that is what the Noticeboard is for. \n\n\nDo not use CAPITAL LETTERS, it gives the impression that you are shouting. Don't be vulgar.\n\n\nconcise title/subject of the post\n\n\nIt is very important to give a concise title, so that it \ndescribes what the post is about and others can better navigate. Do not \nuse headings like \"Help\", \"Question\", \"Problem\", \"Advise\".\n\n\ncopying posts\n\n\nDo not copy posts from another thread, system or private mail \nunless you are sure the author agrees.

If someone responds to \nan unrelated comment, they will start an off topic subthread.\n\n\nthread moderation\n\n\nTry to keep the level of discussion as high as possible. Do not\n limit the plurality of opinions. Penalize (by reprimanding and deleting\n posts) diversions from the topic. Penalize violations of the rules. \nAnswer questions from contributors when you can.

The principle of SPF is that the\n recipient of the letter (in your case, for example, gmail.com) checks \nwhether the address of the sender of the letter matches the address of \nthe computer from which the letter was actually sent. If it does not \nmatch, the recipient may reject the email as undeliverable.\n\n\n\nTip: Example\nHere's\n an example: The user xxx@mail.muni.cz set up in IS MU to redirect mail \nto\n xxx@gmail.com. When e-mails are sent to user xxx@mail.muni.cz from eg \nmail-services.com, it may\n reject gmail.com's e-mails, because an email that appears to have been \nsent from mail-services.com actually came from mail.muni.cz.\nBecause the user has forwarded mail from IS MU.\n\n\n\nIf you have redirected letters from IS MU and the letters return to you as undeliverable,\n the solution is either to cancel the redirection of mail from IS MU or to change\n the addressee of the e-mail on the server mail-services.com to the destination xxx@gmail.com\n (and not to the forwarding mail xxx@mail.muni.cz).\n\n\n\nTip: Technical specification\nThe\n sender's server administrator can set up from which computers his \ne-mails can be sent.\n Therefore, the sender's server administrator can solve the IS MU \nforwarding problem by entering the IS MU address\n into the list of computers from which it sends e-mails.

                "answer": "The\n system searches for similarities across the shared database of compared\n documents, which includes, in addition to the IS MU document server, \nfinal theses of participating schools in the\n          \nTheses.cz\n system, seminar and other theses in the \n       \nOdevzdej.cz\n, system, scientific publications in the\n       \nRepozitar.cz\n system and other documents in information systems operated by MU.\n\n\n\n\nBecause a significant amount of work and documents are not public, \nsearching the common database is an effective tool for finding possible \nplagiarism. A student cannot just submit a seminar paper to a friend \nfrom another school, because there is a high probability that he is \nalready in the system and there would be similarities. The assignment of\n seminar and final thesis topics is often repeated, and it is therefore \nlikely that the system will already know about the source documents from\n which this topic is usually drawn.\n\n\nThe search for similarities also includes an algorithm that analyzes the\n document being compared and examines it from sources on the Internet. \nThis procedure has various technical limitations and is computationally \nand time consuming. Therefore, it is preferably used for archives of \nfinal theses. Due to the speed of processing, seminar papers in \nsubmission offices and long answers in ROPOTs are primarily compared \nagainst a shared database of all source documents. This includes, among \nother things, resources from the Internet, which have been traced in the\n past for the purpose of checking some of the millions of final theses \nbeing compared.\n\n\nHowever, there is a difference between finding similarities to seminar \npapers (for which the shared resource database is used) and final papers\n (for which the shared resource database is enriched with newly \ndownloaded resources from the Internet). But there is no need to worry, \nthe database is really large, so in most cases the system \"knows\" enough\n resources that students usually draw from, as well as enough resources \nthat students usually describe.\n        \n\n\nTip: Files in File Depository and My Web won't be displayed to others\nFiles in File Depository and My Web  will be included in the\nsimilarity searches only if they are in the user's File Depository or user's My\nWeb.

                "answer": "There are two basic options: specifying the from-to interval and the total number of minutes the ROPOT can be worked with.\n\t\nSetting the from-to interval (period during which the application can be worked with)\n\n\t\tYou can select the date and time from and until which the ROPOT can be\n worked with. You can either enter both data or only one of them. You \ncan set more than one interval for accessing the ROPOT.\n\n\t  \nSetting the total time for the test\n\n\t\tAnother option is to specify the total number of minutes that the \nROPOT \ncan be worked with. The time is counted for each person separately from \nthe moment the ROPOT session is first launched. Although the teacher can\n set the student to return to the ROPOT session and work with it \nrepeatedly, the total time is still counted from the first time the \nROPOT session is launched.\n\n\t  \nCombining the two methods\n\n\t\tYou can combine both types of time restriction. The limit that expires\n first will apply. For example, you have a ROPOT where the interval is \nset to 15:00 to 16:00 and 10 minutes. If a student launches the ROPOT at\n 15:55, they will only have 5 minutes to answer it. If he/she opens it \nat 15:00, he/she will have 10 minutes.\n\n\nThe combination of time constraints can be used, for example, in real\n examinations for grades. For example, you want to give students 30 \nminutes of time and at the same time you don't want students to lose \nsome of their time due to a delay in the start of the test. In such a \nsituation it is convenient to set the interval e.g. 10:00\u201311:30 and at \nthe same time the total number of minutes to 30. Each student will have \n30 minutes to work and it does not matter whether he/she opens the test \nat 10:00 or 10:05. Only students who open the test at 11:01 or later \nwould be disadvantaged.\n\n\nYou can do the same in tests designed for practice during the \nsemester. For example, you want students to work with the ROPOT \nrepeatedly over a period of time (e.g., March to May), but only for a \nlimited amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes). In this type of testing, you \nneed to have the parameter \"yes, they should and some other questions \nshould be offered to them next time they work with the ROPOT \napplication\". This is because if you set it to \"yes, they should, but it\n is always the same form (same questions) that should be offered to \nthem\", the time from the first time the ROPOT session is launched is \ncounted. In our case, if the student saved the test after 10 minutes and\n came back to it after half an hour, he/she would not be able to work \nwith it anymore because the 20 minutes would have passed in the \nmeantime.\n\n\nMultiple periods during which the ROPOT can be worked with is\n useful in the case of tests on multiple dates for different groups or \nseminars within a course or courses using shared study materials. This \neliminates the need to create multiple ROPOT descriptions for a single \ntest that is intended for different groups of students. It is also \nimportant that all groups of students who are to work with the ROPOT at a\n given time also have the appropriate rights assigned. For example, you \nwant to give one test to two groups of students. The first examination \ndate is at 10:00, the second at 14:00. In the ROPOT description, you set\n the date and time in the first line to, for example, 10:00\u201311:00, and \nin the second line to 14:00\u201315:00. Thus, one description is used for two\n examination dates.\n\n\nWith both types of time constraints, the student can see how much \ntime is left. For the last 5 minutes, a red warning appears on the \ncounter indicating the end of the test and flashes for the last minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Students see that the time for answering the ROPOT is coming to an end.\n\n",

The correctness of the answer is checked using the Maple \nprogram, allowing, for example, to correctly evaluate different \nnotations of the same expression (e.g., \"1/2*sin x\" a \"sin(x)/2\"). \nTherefore, in order to evaluate the question, the student must write the answer in Maple syntax.\n\n\n\n        The correctness checking of the answer can be influenced by a \nwhitelist and a blacklist of allowed and disallowed functions or \nprocedures that may or may not appear in the answer. You can make only \ncertain functions available to students for an answer or prevent Maple \nfrom calculating its own answer using a Maple function.\n\n        The definition of a question is similar to the :t and :tt types,\n where the number of underscores after the \":l\" character determines the\n length of the input field.  \n        The following examples show how to use whitelist and blacklist.\n        \n\n\nExample question with whitelist:\n\n        Derive the function <M>f(x)=cos(2*x)</M>\n\n        :l_________________\n\n        :l=\"-2*sin(2*x) w[sin, cos]\" ok \n\n\n(Only the sine and cosine functions can be used for the answer.)\n\n\n\n\nExample question with blacklist:\n\n        Derive the function <M>f(x)=x^5</M>\n\n        :l_________________\n\n        :l=\"5*x^4 b[diff, Diff]\" ok \n\n\n(You cannot use the derivation function to specify a derivative expression.)\n\n\n\n        If neither whitelist nor blacklist is used in the answer \ndefinition, the so-called authoring solution is used, which \nautomatically uses the whitelist from the functions used in the correct \nvariant.\n        \nYou can use HTML tags in the assignment, and the \nHTML editor for the question assignment.

The correctness of the answers is verified by \nthe teacher's external server, where the teacher himself/herself runs \nthe correctness check of the expression/algorithm.\n          \nScore (points) awarded: Please ensure that at least one of the fields \ncontains \u201cok\u201d\n,\n which marks the correct answer. The score that is to be awarded for an \nalternative can be entered either in the form of a number, in which case\n it denotes the number of points awarded/subtracted if the alternative \nis selected, or that of percentage. Examples:\n\n          ok\n\n          ok 2\n\n          ok 75%\n\n          -1\n\n          -50%\n\n         There should always be a space between \nok\n and \nthe value. As regards the conditions the student must meet in order to \nscore 100 percent, you will be able to specify these in the ROPOT \ndescription section later on. The student is usually awarded the score \n(number of points) assigned to the alternative he/she selects. Unless \nyou assign a score to one of the alternatives here, the student is \nawarded the default one specified in the ROPOT description.\n          \nTo format your text, you can use the HTML editor or HTML tags (the former only applies to the question sections).\n          \nThe definition of the answer depends on the agreement\n with the development team. Typically, the teacher writes the correct \nanswer in the form \na:control_values\n, and these values (\ncontrol_values\n) are used by the external server (\na\n)\n as parameters to evaluate the student's answer. The external server \nalso evaluates and processes the answer based on an agreement with the \ndevelopment team. The return string generally must not contain values of\n the ok/nok type (whether the answer was correct or not), but may also \ncontain textual feedback or other scoring (even percentage).\n\n",

Students can open the practice test at any time and view\n the correct results after submitting it.\n\t  \n    \nPC-based test\n\n\nA clicker exam that students take in the computer classroom.\n The test is typically timed and the results are recorded in a notebook \n(the ability to generate a grade) without displaying the correct answers\n to the students.\n\t  \n    \nPC-based test demo\n\n\nThe mode is used to easily create a sample test on which \nstudents can experience what a live PC-based test looks like. It is \nadvisable to include it during the semester with sufficient distance \nfrom the actual testing. The results are not saved.\n\t  \n    \nText (accompanied by other materials) or opinion poll\n\n\nUnscored questions with some accompanying texts \u2013 shorter \ninteractive teaching materials (with checking of understanding of the \ntext), surveys, questionnaires. The order of questions and answers is \nnot mixed.\n\t  \n    \nScannable test (multiple choice)\n\n\nCreating a printable test and then completing it on paper. \nThe results are entered into a notebook after scanning the submitted \npaper. The scans are also stored in the student's Retrieval Box for \nreview. Please note: the contents of the  \nshort\n  answer sheet are entered in full, including the assignment, when uploading to the student's retrieval box.\n\t  \n    \nScannable handwritten text and scores\n\n\nA very specific mode \u2013 the printed assignment with a free \nspace is filled in manually by the student and the teacher manually \ncorrects and enters the points. After scanning, the number of points is \nentered into a notebook and the corrected paper is available in the \nRetrieval Box.\n\n",

For each session, the date, time, and all operations made \nduring a session are recorded.\n\nOperations\n\n\nThe operation means opening, saving, submitting, viewing by \nrespondent and changing the marking of right/wrong answers in the \nevaluation section by teacher. The system records all operations that \nare performed on the ROPOT session.\n\nSession in progress\n\n\nIf a respondent launches the ROPOT, fills in at least one \nanswer and saves it using \u201cSave and continue\u201d button, and does not use \nthe \"Submit\" button, this session is marked as a session in progress. It\n is desirable that the sessions do not remain in progress, as only after\n submission will the test be evaluated (and the result written in the \nnotebook, if required). A turquoise icon with an exclamation mark \nindicates a session in progress. An in-progress session can be ended \neither by the respondent submitting the test or by the teacher changing \nthe save to submit in the session (for a tool to end a work-in-progress \nsession, see the handling key icon \u2013 i. e. \u201cEdit session\u201d button).\n\nMismatch in number of started sessions, session reopened, session still unanswered\n\n\nThis is supplementary information, especially for cases where a\n student reports difficulty working with the answer key. They are \nnotifications\n of a non-standard number or order of some operations. Mismatch in the \nnumber of started sessions highlights situations where there has been a \nmismatch\n in the number of times the ROPOT has been opened and submitted or vice \nversa. Re-opened session highlights a situation where the respondent has\n already\n submitted their answers at least once in the sessione, but then \nreturned to the test again by clicking on 'Re-answer' and has not yet \nmade any\n changes to their answers since then. For the passage with no answers so\n far, the answerer has made a new assignment but has not filled in any \nanswers.\n\nOpened\n\n\nThe date and time of launching the ROPOT session by respondent \nis recorded accordingly. For a compiled test sheet, it indicates the \ndate and time the compiled test sheet was created (typically a compiled \ntest sheet for scannable exam).\n\nSaved\n\n\nIt records the date and time when the respondent used the \"Save\n and Continue\" button or when the continuous save occurred \nautomatically.\n\nSubmitted\n\n\nThe date and time when the respondent clicked on the \"Submit\" \nbutton and the ROPOT session was evaluated, or when the session was \nautomatically submitted at the end of the time limit for taking the \ntest, is recorded\n\nViewed\n\n\nThe date and time at which the respondent viewed their answers \nis recorded.

The usual procedures are: \n\n        \nEach examination date has a unique assignment stored in a\n separate question set, the test questions are mixed (each student sees \nthem in a different order)\n        \nFor example, there are three different question sets, each set to be used on multiple examination dates.\n        \nThere is only one assignment = question set.\n\n\n\n        How many ROPOTs:\n\nAccess to a single ROPOT can be \"given and taken\" over time. It can \nbe made accesible on Mondays 8.00-9.00, then 14.00-15.00, etc., as the \nexamination dates are organized. A student who has already taken the \ntest cannot change the answers, but can look at the wording of the \nquestions should he/she reopen the ROPOT when the next examination date \nis in progress. \n\nThis can be avoided if \nyou restrict access\n to the ROPOT to \na specific part of the computer network (the classroom \u2013 LVT department will help)\n,\n  so that it is not freely accessible from the internet. If you cannot \nuse this restriction and do not want students to be able to return to \nthe assignment, create a separate ROPOT description for each examination\n date.\n        \nSecurity mechanisms\n\n\nFind out from the technical support of the computer \nroom the range of addresses of the computer network of the classroom \n(the so-called IP addresses) and enter them in the description of the \nROPOT\u2013 the section   \n\"On which computers should the students be allowed to work with the ROPOT application?\"\n.

You can choose the colour of the column to \ndistinguish e.g. individual test dates.\n        \nIf you have set up the display of the left column \n(see the previous paragraph), the identity of the respondent, i.e. the \nname, u\u010do and photo of the person logged in, will also be displayed. \nThis will make it easier to check the identity of the respondent.\n        \n        \nYou can contact the \nfaculty CIT\n  to ask if it would be possible to  \ndisable access to\n other sites than \n is.muni.cz.\n\n\nWhat else is good to know...\n\n\nThe student cannot unknowingly open the ROPOT twice \n(e.g. by double-clicking). If such a situation occurs, MU IS will ask \nthe student whether he/she really wants to open the ROPOT a second time.\n The same question will be asked if the student wants to open the \nunsaved test in two browser windows or panels. Whether he/she will be \nable to do this depends on the setting of the parameters in the ROPOT \ndescription,\n        \nbut the ROPOT cannot be reopened and the answers cannot \nbe continued/changed if the setting is \"no (once you open the ROPOT, you\n cannot reopen the ROPOT sometime later and change the answers)\".\n.\n        \n\n        Students have a \"Save and continue\" button to prevent \ninconveniences caused by power outages, etc. If you set in the ROPOT \ndescription for the test to have multiple pages, \u201csave and continue\u201d is \ndone automatically when a respondent moves between pages.

                "answer": "Peer\n Assessment is an application in the MU IS implementing the pedagogical \nassessment process where students evaluate each other. In the \nEnglish-language literature, this concept is known as \"peer assessment\" \nor, less precisely, \"peer review\".\n\n\nThe basic difference between the above-mentioned terms lies in \nthe choice of the so-called evaluators, i.e. the persons responsible for\n assessing the submitted work and drawing up an opinion. Whereas in the \npeer assessment process, the submitter and the assessors are typically \nstudents and often come from the same set of individuals, in the case of\n peer review, the assessors are carefully selected from among experts in\n the field with the aim of providing a qualified and impartial review of\n the submitted scientific work while ensuring a high degree of \nrelevance. The basic mechanism for the collection and distribution of \nfiles and results is identical for both use cases.",

                "question": "Why use Peer Assessment in teaching?",
                "answer": "There\n are a number of reasons to incorporate student peer assessment into \nteaching. The following list outlines at least some of them:\n     \nIn the process of producing their assessments, students\n develop their critical thinking skills, their ability to look \nobjectively at others' work and to produce constructive criticism.\n      \nStudents get feedback not only from the teacher, the \nauthority figure, but also from colleagues - their criticism can be more\n easily accepted by students.\n        \nEvaluators can also be students of a completely \ndifferent course, e.g. from a higher year, for whom it may be part of \ntheir preparation for a teaching career or an opportunity to improve \nfurther professional competences.\n        \nThe application also allows specifying individual \npersons as assessors, so that the teacher can distribute the correction \nof assignments among his/her doctoral students or colleagues who do not \nteach the course .\n      \nThe teacher can easily get more assessments of any number\n of papers as the number of assessors increases with the number of \nstudents.\n\n       When students assess other students, they are actively engaged in\n the learning process. Creating a good assessment naturally requires a \ngood knowledge of the field, which can lead them to further learning. If\n they process multiple papers by their peers, they have the opportunity \nto gain insight into the thinking of a number of students who have \nworked on the same or similar assignments.",

                "answer": "In the Peer Assessment application\n     \nInformation system \n Teacher \n [course selection] \n (Peer assessment) \n Administrator\n\n    you need to click on the \"Create new\" option. The text in this \nsection of the help only deals with the type of peer assessment where \nboth submitters and evaluators are individuals. The specifics of peer \nassessment with groups are addressed in the question \nHow do I set up a peer assessment where the submitters or evaluators are groups?\n\n\nThe setting up of the peer assessment is divided into five points (or steps):\n\n\nName of the peer assessment:\n Filling in \nbasic information such as the name, instructions for submitters, date \nthe peer assessment will be made available to the submitters (i.e. the \ndate when the peer assessment is displayed in the MU IS to submitters, \nnot when the distribution of files takes place or the assessment \nbegins), setting up the sending of informational emails, specifying the \nhidden identity of the submitting student(s) or evaluator(s), etc. \n        \n\n\nSubmission:\n setting up a new homework \nvault or selecting from existing ones. In the case of setting up new \nhomework vault, you need to set a date by which students can submit \ntheir files. Only students who have uploaded at least one file to at \nleast one of the selected homework vaults are considered as submitters \nduring distribution.\n        \n\n\nEvaluator selection:\n in the simplest \ncase, just turn on the \"Submitters are evaluators\" mode. Alternatively, \nyou can specify the evaluators as students of courses or seminar groups,\n or individually specified by UIN (u\u010do). Only those courses are offered \nfor which the teacher has the right. The IS remembers the settings and \nevaluates the real persons only at the moment of distributing the files \nto the evaluators. Peer assessment can therefore be set up at the very \nbeginning of the semester.\n\n\nIf one student submits multiple files (even to multiple \nhomework vaults), the evaluator will have all files from that student. \nIn other words, evaluators are \"assigned\" submitters, not individual \nfiles.\n\n\n\nSet assessment attributes:\n the teacher \nmust specify the start and end of the assessment and how many times one \nsubmitter should be assessed, or how many submitters should be assigned \nto one assessor. In the \"Enable the evaluation of instructor's file\" \nsection, it is possible to set the teacher's assessment files (see \nquestion \nhere\n).\n All settings must be feasible at the time of distribution or the \ndistribution will fail. This step can also be used to set a later date \nfor the results to be published to students than the end of the \nassessment. If the results are transferred to notebooks, the results \nwill be published on this date. \n\n\n\nCreate evaluation form:\n The teacher \nhas an advanced WYSIWYG (informal \"what you see is what you get\") \nevaluation form editor. Here, the teacher can specify a series of \nquestions that he/she then guides the evaluator through in creating \ntheir evaluation. There are questions with one or more possible answers,\n free text, marking and scoring. For each question, the teacher can \nspecify whether its value is to be stored in the student's notebook. \n",

                "answer": "Peer assessment allows for the following basic combinations:\n\n\nThe submitters and evaluators are groups\n      \nSubmitters are groups, evaluators are individuals\n      \nSubmitters are individuals, evaluators are groups\n      \nThe submitters and evaluators are individuals\n\n\nIn the application\n     \nInformation system \n Teacher \n [course selection] \n (Peer assessment) \n Administrator\n\n     you need to click \"Create new\" and under the first step \"Name of \nthe peer assessment\" select \"Enable group assessments\". The whole \nprocess of setting up a peer assessment is divided into five steps (or \npoints), which are described in detail in the question \nHow do I set up a peer\nassessment?\n This section of the help focuses on the settings in steps 2 and 3, which are different for group peer assessments.\n\nPeer assessment, which has group assessments enabled, allows the \nfollowing settings for submitters and evaluators to form groups:\n\n     \nWithout sorting into groups\n \u2013 Individual students are the submitters or evaluators, not groups.\n      \nSort students randomly\n \u2013 Peer assessment will set up a topic list with a sufficient number of groups (topics) and assign students to them randomly.\n      \nStudents sign in on their own\n \u2013 Peer assessment will set up a topic list with enough groups (topics) but will not sign up any students.\n      \nSort students into groups manually\n \u2013 The\n teacher (i.e. the peer assessment administrator) creates groups by \nentering a list of students\u2018 UIN (u\u010do) into the peer assessment editing \nwindow. He/she can also directly edit the names of the future groups.\n      \nPou\u017e\u00edt existuj\u00edc\u00ed rozpis (i.e. Use an existing topic list)\n\n \u2013 The teacher selects a topic list that he/she has previously created \nin the Topic Lists application for the course. The topic list will be \nlinked directly to the peer assessment. A single topic list can only be \nlinked to one peer assessment using this option, and only topic lists \nthat can be linked in this way are offered.\n      \nCopy existing groups\n \u2013 Here the teacher \nselects a topic list that he/she has already created in the course in \nthe Topic Lists application. However, the peer assessment will not \ndirectly link this topic list, but a \none time copy of it\n. If groups of an existing topic list are to be used for peer assessment a second or more time, this option must be selected.\n\n        Any changes to the group names, student sign in, etc. must be \nmade on these copied groups, not on the original topic list, if they are\n to be reflected in the peer assessment. If students are allowed to \nmodify the existing topic list, they must be informed.\n\n\nTo divide students into groups, peer assessment uses the Topic Lists \napplication in the course Teacher's Notebook, where the groups are the \ntopics in the course topic list and the students registered for the \ntopic are members of the group so named. In most cases, however, there \nis no need to set up anything in Topic Lists.\n\n\nMembers of the groups can only be students of the course in which the\n topic list is located or of the courses between which it is shared. If \npeer assessment is set up for multiple courses, groups are created (or \nset up) so that students from all courses can be enrolled in them \n(details below).\n\n\nAt the time of the start of the evaluation, the \ntopic lists\n with groups linked to the peer assessment \nare locked\n. This means that they can no longer be edited and will only be available in view mode.\n\n\nSimilar to peer assessment for individuals, the setting that the \ngroups submitting are the same as those they are evaluating can be used \nfor groups. Both the submitters and the evaluators assigned to the \ngroups can be students from different courses or seminar groups.\n\n\nThe specifics of the groups submitting:\n\n\nIf the submitters are grouped, it is highly desirable to \ncheck the\n option for notifying the submitter by email in step 1 \"Name of the peer assessment\", because \nonly then will the application send the\n students the \ninformation that\n, they have been signed in a group for peer assessment or that they should sign in one.\n      \nSubmission \ngroups are formed on the date and time\n\n that the peer assessment is published to students and students are \nsubsequently informed of their signing in or obligation to sign in if \nthis is set in point 1. It is therefore desirable to set the date of \npublication of the peer assessment well in advance of the submission \ndate.\n      \nA student is \nconsidered a member of\n a group by the application if he/she joins the group (is enrolled) no later than the start of the evaluation of the files.\n      \nApplication-generated \nsubmission groups are created for courses\n\n whose students are allowed to upload into one of the linked homework \nvaults (if they are still allowed to upload) or whose students have a \nfile loaded in one of the homework vaults (if it is an already closed \nhomework vault). The homework vault must be located in the study \nmaterials of the course for which the peer assessment is created. If the\n peer assessment is to be a group assessment for multiple courses, it \nmust be shared, see \nIs it possible to create a peer assessment that is common to multiple courses?\n\n\nA group is considered a (successful) submitter by the \napplication if at least one member submits at least one file to at least\n one of the connected homework vaults. Such a file is considered to be \nthe work of the whole group.\n\n\nThe specifics of the evaluator groups:\n\n\nThe groups of assessors\n created by the \"Sort students randomly\" and \"Sort students into groups manually\" options \nare created\n\n only at the time of distribution of the files to the assessors. \nEvaluator groups created using the \"Students sign in on their own\" \noption are created at the date and time the peer assessment is published\n to students.\n      \nA student is \nconsidered a member of\n a group by the application if he/she joins the group (is enrolled) no later than the start of the evaluation of the files.\n      \nThe whole group of evaluators has one common \nevaluation form\n\n and it is sufficient for one member of the group to enter the \nevaluation, as it is assumed that it is the result of joint work. It is \nrecommended that the whole group meets for the evaluation at one \ncomputer (or via video call) and one member enters the evaluation for \nall. The evaluation form does not support simultaneous editing by \nmultiple members of the same group.",

                "answer": "Yes,\n if this is set in the peer assessment using the attributes \"[ ] \nEvaluate the files of the instructor\" and \"[ ] all evaluators\" (Step 4 \nof Set assessment attributes). If neither of these two attributes is \nchecked, files uploaded by teachers to linked homework vaults are \nignored during distribution. That is, the teacher cannot upload a file \non behalf of a student (e.g., sent by email) into the homework vault.\n\n\nIf the attributes are checked as follows:\n\n\nthen the teacher who uploads (or submits) at least one file to one of \nthe connected homework vaults will be considered a common submitter \nduring distribution and his/her files will be randomly assigned to one \nof the evaluators according to the distribution priority setting. In \nthis way, it is possible to test how a random evaluator evaluates the \nfiles of a teacher. At the same time, it is also possible to try how the\n submitting student sees the peer assessment at different stages.\n\n\nIf the attributes are checked as follows:\n\n\nthen the teacher will ensure that all students will also evaluate all \nteachers' files, and the evaluators will be assigned to evaluate all \nteachers' files that have submitted at least one file to one of the \nconnected homework vaults, in addition to the number of files set in the\n distribution priority.\n\n\nIf only teacher files are to be evaluated, the frequency should be set to 0 times as the distribution priority.\n\n\nFor example, the requirement for assessors to be provided with a model assignment can be addressed in this way.\n\n\nThe current application capabilities do not yet allow to solve the \nrequirement when the teacher wants to distribute x files among the \nstudents so that one student always receives just one file from the \nteacher (each evaluator is always assigned all files from the teacher).",

All peer assessments that the teacher creates (or \nclicks \"Edit\" and then saves) with these selected courses will be shared\n between them. If the teacher selects \"Close without saving\", sharing \nbetween courses will not be set up.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Peer assessments shared between two courses.\n\n\nSharing of peer assessment between courses cannot be abolished. \nIf sharing is not desired, it is possible to delete the peer assessment \nand create a new peer assessment (i.e. a copy of it) from its settings. \nHowever, this is not always necessary. The submitters are always \nstudents of the course (in which the peer assessment is located) who \nhave submitted at least one file to the attached homework vault (or have\n the right to the attached homework vault), and the evaluators are \ndetermined by the settings in step 3.

There are no other \nlimitations to peer assessment.\n\n\nWhen evaluating a video (or audio recording) created by \nstudents, the format they use may be problematic if it cannot be played \ndirectly in a browser, or if it can only be played on devices with a \nparticular operating system, etc. As a precaution, we recommend asking \nstudents to convert the recorded video (or audio) to HTML5 format, which\n can be played directly in the browser without downloading, even in peer\n assessment. If necessary, the teacher can also do this conversion (but \nnot upload the file in the homework vault).\n\n\nThe procedure for conversion to HTML5 format is described in detail in the Help \nhere\n.\nConversion can be done for multiple checked files at the same time.

                "answer": "E-\nlearning is a learning process using information technology, including \nthe network environment. There are two main objectives. The first \nobjective is to \ndevelop distance learning\n. \nStatistically, it is known that a significant proportion of students \nfail to complete the course when studying on their own without a \nteacher. E-learning techniques try to partially replace the role of the \nteacher by: \n\n\nadvanced study materials, where the student chooses the level of\n depth (difficulty) of the discussed topic and where the explanation is \nsupplemented by multimedia - pictures, recordings, video recordings,\n\ntest applications, where the student can test how well he/she understands the material and can apply it,\n\ncommunication applications that put the self-student in contact\n with classmates and the tutor (discussion forum, real-time discussion \non a computer network),\n\nadministrative tools that help the teacher to effectively \nassess students, generate statistics on which the course can be further \nimproved, etc.\n\nWell-designed, didactically sound, fully e-learning courses can make \nhigher education accessible to people who cannot attend full-time \nclasses. In the IS MU environment, both free and commercial e-learning \ncourses can be designed for the general public. \n\n\n\nThe second objective is to \npromote mainstream forms of teaching\n.\n The MU Information System offers the tools described above to all \nteachers to support their pedagogical goals. The tools can be used \ncompletely independently or in cooperation with faculty support - e.g. \nyou need help with converting study material into a suitable format, \nwith creating a set of test questions, with setting up the Course \nCatalogue so that your assigned tutors (e.g. selected students) can \nmoderate the discussion forum, answer questions, correct homework. If \nyou are interested in being e-learning active, please inquire with the \nfaculty \ne-technician\n or contact him at \n \netech@fi.muni.cz\n.\n\n     ",

Such a course (independent of semester and course) can be made \navailable by its author/teacher to any person (even to a person without \nthe u\u010do).\n\nA course intended for the public can be made available free of charge to interested students\n or sold through the Shopping Center MU.\n\nA person without the u\u010do can create an account in the IS MU (thus \nobtaining the u\u010do) and can enrol in published e-learning courses.

Finally, students need someone to \nanswer their questions related\nto the subject matter as well as those pertaining to the ways of using \nthe electronic material.\n\n\nHowever, the very communication and techniques of maintaining it to the desirable extent may also represent a hindrance\nwhen not handled properly. Teachers are therefore advised to motivate\ntheir students to ask questions and participate in discussions actively.  On the other hand,\nassigning your students too many communication-involving tasks requiring a lot of participation on your part\nmight eventually keep you rather busy.

Eventually, the teacher evaluates the quality of the student's feedback.\n\n\n\nUtilizing discussion groups for the aforementioned activities proves useful when you\nhave some experience of moderating your students' discussion since each of them may\nmake multiple contributions and the total number of these may turn out to be rather overwhelming.\nIf this is not the case, you might want to use \nhomework vaults\n or\n\ne-surveys\n instead.\n\t",

In this way, the teacher has the \nopportunity to check that the information entered by him/her into the \nNotebook has reached the student correctly, that he/she has set up the \ninteractive course syllabus correctly, that he/she has set up the ROPOT \nparameters correctly, etc. \n      \n\n      The mechanism was introduced at the request of teachers who wanted\n to introduce a student identity for testing into the system. However, a\n student identity for testing would not be usable in this MU IS (unlike \nother systems) because the person who has enrolled in the course does \nnot have common and uniform student rights (as is usual in other \nsystems), but has individual rights. Students may differ in their study \nstatus, seminar group, may have individual rights, etc. \n      \n\n      A teacher can use someone else's identity via:\n        \nInformation system \n Teacher \n [course selection] \n(ROPOTs and Quizzes) \n E-learning from a student's point of view\n\n",

So, for example, he or she can \ncheck what the homework vault folder tree looks like from the student's \npoint of view and whether the student has sufficient access rights to \nupload their file. The teacher under someone else's identity cannot \nupload or manage files on behalf of a student. The teacher can only do \nthis under his/her own identity.\n\n\n      \nFile Manager\n\n\nIn the File Manager, the teacher can only choose \nsomeone else's identity when viewing the Study Materials.

If a teacher attempts to upload a file in\n the File Manager with a changed identity, the operation will be \nperformed, but the teacher will be listed as the uploader even though \nsomeone else's identity remains selected. If the teacher gets to a \nlocation where someone else's identity is no longer applied, in addition\n to the red bar disappearing, an informational message will alert the \nteacher.\n\n      \nROPOTs\n\n\nThe teacher can look at the ROPOTs and see if he/she \nhas set the ROPOT correctly. The teacher is not allowed to launch a new \nROPOT session or save the answers in behalf of the student. However, the\n teacher can change the last student\u2019s save operation to submitted in \nthe Responses application in the Teacher's Notebook in special case when\n the student does not finish his/her ROPOT session by submission of \nhis/hers answers.

This can be set straight away\n when preparing the ROPOT before printing the test sheets or at any time\n afterwards.\n      \n\nThese are the settings under \"Display the correct answers to students \nafter they have finished working with the ROPOT application\" and \"Rights\n and time groups\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nDisplay setting options.\n In case of limiting the viewing \"only to\", it is necessary to take into\n account that students can print the displayed questions from the \nbrowser and have them available after this date.\n\n\n\n      Who is allowed to work with the ROPOT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Who is allowed to work \nwith the ROPOT: Typically, this will be students enrolled for a specific\n examination date or all students in a course; it will be those students\n who are allowed  to view the responses they provided. You need to click\n on \"Add another right\", here you need to select the option \"students \nwith a reservation on an examination date\" (or other suitable option), \nthen select a specific examination date (or other refinement) from the \nmenu and confirm by clicking on \"Add the right\".\n\n\n2\n When the ROPOT can be worked with: If \nthe option \"No, never (select this option provided the test is to be \nscanned and you only want to make it available for browsing).\" is \nchecked in the \"Should students be allowed to access this ROPOT \napplication repeatedly?\" section, the content of the boxes can be left \nblank and students will only have access to the viewing their answers.\n\n\nFinally, you need to specify the folder to which the link to the \nROPOT should be placed. The course usually has a preset folder for ROPOT\n (Revision, Opinion Poll and Testing) in Study Materials and this \nsetting does not need to be changed. The description of the ROPOT needs \nto be saved via the \"Save and make accessible\" button.\n\n\n\n\n\n      In the case of ROPOT in the \"scannable handwritten text and scores\"\nmode, students can see a scan of their answer sheet in their Retrieval\nBox according to the settings (the time and date from which students\nwill be able to access the previews in the Retrieval Box can be set\nwhen checking results of recognition process). You can also make scans\nof answer sheets available to students in responses view by setting\nthe ROPOT as accessible in the ROPOT description (the \"Save and make\naccessible\" button).\n      ",

                "question": "Scanning of handwritten tests (i.e. free-form answers, not multiple choice)",
                "answer": "Scanning\n handwritten tests is an option a teacher can use if he/she wants \nstudents to write the solution to a problem on paper (drawing graphs, \npictures, etc.).\nThe teacher can then correct the students' paper solutions and give them\n a score. \n\n The teacher can write the evaluation comment and points directly on\nthe answer sheets and then scan them in, or if the teacher prefers to\nenter the evaluation comment and points on the computer, he/she can\nscan the answer sheets first and then add the evaluation comment and\npoints in the Responses application.\n\n\n    \n\n    Students can have multiple problems on multiple sheets of paper. The\n student writes their answers on the front side of the answer sheet. \nThey can also write on the reverse side, but this is not scanned so the \nstudent will not see it in the IS MU.\nOnce the paper has been corrected and marked by the teacher and entered \ninto the IS MU, students can see their answers and the teacher's \ncomments in the IS MU.\n    \n\n\nThe basic procedure is illustrated in the following commented video, a\nmore detailed procedure including all options is specified in the text\nbelow:\n\n\n0:00\n2:49\nSpeed\n90 %\n100 %\n125 %\n150 %\nQuality\n (High)\nAuto\nHigh\nLow\nDownload\n(quality)\nHigh\nLow\nOriginal\nAlways show controls\nInformation System\nadministered by Faculty of Informatics, MU\n\n\n\n\n    Procedure:\n\n\nCreate a ROPOT description for scannable handwritten tests (see \nROPOT description\n).\n    \nPrint out the dispatch form if necessary (see \nHow to prepare the test (test sheets, answer sheets and dispatch form) for students?\n).\n    \nPrint out enough answer sheets or copy the answer sheet (see \nHow to prepare the test (test sheets, answer sheets and dispatch form) for students?\n).\n    \nYou can either prepare the assignment on a separate sheet \nwith students writing their answers on printed answer sheets with the \nheader, or you can copy the assignment under the header on the answer \nsheet. However, you must not interfere with the machine-processable zone\n (it is marked on the answer sheet).\n    \nThe student fills in the sheet number (e.g. 3 sheets in \ntotal \u2013 each sheet will have one or more questions) and his/her u\u010do. The\n student will complete the paper.\n    See\n    \n\n\nHelp \n Teacher \n Tips on examinations based on scannable answer sheets\n\n\nCorrect the handwritten test by hand, you can write \nyour comments on the front side. Only the front side is scanned, the \nreverse side is not scanned. For correcting, you can choose whether you \nwant to correct and scan the paper in colour or black and white. If you \nchoose to scan in black and white to distinguish corrections and teacher\n comments, it is recommended that you use a thick black marker, for \nexample.\n    \nEnter the number of points in the box provided. In case you\n make a mistake and need to correct it, write in pencil and erase any \nerrors. The second way is to write, for example, the letter E instead of\n a number in a blank, which will cause the error to be reported later. \nThe error can then be corrected manually.\n    \nScan the answer sheets with the dispatch form either on \nyour own or with a user support employee. When sending to the IS, place \nthe dispatch form either before or after the scanned papers.\n\n\nNote\nIf\n you have corrected the papers in colour, you need to set the scanning \nprogram skenovani.exe to scan \"in colour\" instead of \"greyscale\" before \nyou start scanning.\n\n\nThe handwritten tests are recognised and checked (see \nChecking results of recognition process \u2013 evaluation of the answer sheets\n)\n    \nAfter checking, the results are entered into the IS. The IS\n MU will automatically create notebooks for each answer sheet, i.e. in \nnotebook 1 will be the scores of all students from answer sheet 1, in \nnotebook 2 from answer sheet 2, etc. In the notebooks, the scores are \nentered with an asterisk. \nIn the Teacher's Notebook \u2013 using the function \"Add up scores stored in \ndifferent notebooks\" \u2013 will determine the total number of points by \nadding up the notebooks for sheet 1, sheet 2, etc.\n   \n\n   If you plan to correct students' answers on your computer (i.e., you\nhave set the ROPOT description to be manually evaluated), then you can\nenter the grading comments and scores in the Responses application,\nwhere you will find a preview of the scanned student answer sheets and\na text box where you can enter verbal comments and scores.\n    \nFinally, you can enter an evaluation according to the total number of points (see \nChecking results of recognition process \u2013 evaluation of the answer sheets\n).\n    \nScanned answer sheets are placed in the retrieval box for students to review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Student response.\n\n\n2\n Teacher's comment.\n\n\n3\n Number of points awarded, written by the teacher.\n\n",

                "question": "What are the rules for using the system?",
                "answer": "The\n user may use the MU Information System (MU IS) in accordance with its \nacademic, educational and research mission and primarily for the \nadministrative and operational purposes of the school.\n  \n\n  The use of the MU IS for commercial activities unrelated to the \nschool's activities, political, religious or racial agitation is \nconsidered a violation of the rules.\n  \nThe user works in the MU IS only under the user name assigned to him/her.\n  \nHe/She chooses a non-trivial password for his/hers username \nso that it cannot be guessed. The user must not disclose the password to\n any other person, not even to the system administrator. The user must \nhandle the password in such a way that it cannot be compromised. The \npassword must not be sent by e-mail, as this is an inherently insecure \nservice (it can be intercepted, it can be delivered by mistake to \nanother recipient, etc.).\n  \nIf a user accesses an absent user's session (e.g. by using a \ncomputer on which another user has started work but has not finished it \nso that new access to the MU IS requires password re-execution), the \nuser must terminate the session without delay. \n  \n\n  The user is forbidden to take any action aimed at establishing a \npassword other than his/her own. It is also forbidden to impersonate \nanother or anonymous user or to falsify one's own identity in any way. \n  \n\n  Providing your account to a user who is not entitled to an account in \nthe MU IS or whose account has been blocked is considered a particularly\n serious breach of the rules.\n  \nAdministrative agendas and files in the mail processing \nprocess are the private data of their owners and are entitled to the \nsame privacy protections as other types of personally owned documents. \nViolations of this rule are considered particularly egregious. \n  \n\n  Staff members are responsible for personal data within the scope of the general legal standards (in particular 256/92 Coll.).\n  \nThe user must not burden the IS with bulk operations. If the \nuser is found to be overloading the system with operations that are more\n frequent than the usual load generated by manual clicking, the user may\n be automatically blocked from accessing the IS for a limited period of \ntime. The use of bulk operations is subject to the prior approval of the\n IS operators, who can be contacted at the e-mail address below.\n  \nThe network administrator, or computer administrator, has the\n right to perform all operations necessary to perform his or her \nfunction, including checking the content of files, monitoring user \nactivity, etc. However, the information obtained in this way is strictly\n confidential.\n  \nThe user has the right to use only the software whose license\n allows the user directly or the school in general to do so. This \nincludes software obtained in accordance with the law, including \ncopyright. Copying of software and data (including audio, video files \nand graphics) is only permitted in accordance with the applicable \nlicence conditions.\n  \nA mailbox is primarily set up for users to ensure easy \ncommunication with the school. The user must not compromise the \nreliability and trustworthiness of mail delivery to his/her mailbox \n(e.g., by redirecting mail to unreliable machines, such as machines \nwithout adequate security or without permanent mail processing). \nIn the event that problems with mail delivery caused by the recipient of\n a letter are detected, the administrator is obliged to immediately \nremedy the situation (cancel the redirection) and notify the recipient \nof the situation. \nIn case of recurrence of problems caused by the recipient, the \nadministrator is entitled to block the recipient's accounts.\n  \nThe administrators are not liable for any loss of data \narising in any way. However, this does not relieve them of the \nobligation to regularly back up the contents of the disks of the main MU\n IS  server.\n  \nIt is forbidden to send unsolicited letters to a large number\n of e-mail addresses. In case of violation of the rule, the user will be\n automatically blocked from accessing the mail for 12 hours. It is \nforbidden to send chain, pyramid, etc. letters.\n  \nThe use of vulgar and highly emotive language is prohibited \nin open communication. The user bears full responsibility for any \ndefective content of his/her own letters or other publicly available \ninformation sources.\n  \nAll actions aimed at reducing safety or leading to possible \nviolations of operating rules, both conscious and unconscious, are \nunacceptable. It is forbidden to distribute viruses, worms, glitches, \nTrojan horses, corrupted files, fake messages and other elements of a \ndestructive or fraudulent nature.\n  \nThe user is obliged to follow and unconditionally comply with\n all operating instructions of the administrators (they are communicated\n electronically). The administrators are entitled to additionally \nrespond to the current situation with operating instructions that do not\n contradict these rules.\n\nIn case of any problems, the user has the right to contact \nistech@fi.muni.cz.\nHowever, the user must first study the available electronic manuals for \nthe application. For problems of a technical nature in operating the \ncomputer or accessing the MU IS, the user should contact the local \nfaculty computer administrator of the faculty concerned. Please \nformulate the query or problem specification in sufficient detail and \nattach any relevant error messages.\n  \nIn case of a gross or repeated violation of the rules, the \nuser will be banned from the system or the service in question or \ndisciplinary proceedings will be introduced for violation of the student\n regulations or the school's operating guidelines, with the possibility \nof expulsion from the school and the requirement for financial \ncompensation for the damage caused.",

                "question": "Basic search tips",
                "answer": "The following tips can improve your search.\n      \nbasic query - search for all words\n\n\nIf you enter a term in the form of \npsychologick\u00e9 experimenty\n,\n the results will be displayed regardless of the letter case used. \nMissing diacritics in words\n      will be added automatically and in addition, the results will \ndisplay all possible inflections of the search term (an inflection is a \nmodification of word forms expressing grammatical categories, such as \ngender,\n      number, case, tense, or person; flexible words also use declension\n and conjugation ).\n      \n\n\nExample:\n If you enter \nJarni semestr\n, the search results will also include the term \nV semestru jarn\u00edm\n.\n      \nexact term\n\n\nIf you enter an term in double quotation marks - \n\"psychologick\u00e9 experimenty\"\n - the results will include only the exact term, while the documents containing\n      inflected forms of the term or diacritics will be ignored.\n      \n\n      Note: Even if you do not use quotation marks, the preferred search\n results are those with the search terms in close proximity.\n\n\nExample:\n If you search for the string \n\"icq2go\"\n, the results are thedocuments containing the words \"icq\", \"2\", and \"go\" in a sequence and without\n      inflection or adding diacritics.\n\n\nExample:\n If you search for the string \n\"karel \u010dapek\"\n, the search results are the documents containing this exact term, but not other terms, such as\n     \"karla \u010dapka\". Quotation marks not properly closed are considered to be punctuation marks.       \n\n\nterm without a word\n\n\nIf you enter a term with a minus sign, e.g. \nexperimenty -psychologick\u00e9\n,\n the search results will exclude documents\n      containing the word immediately following the minus sign. Do not \ninflect the word and do not\n      add diacritics. The minus sign must be preceded by a space or it \nmust appear at the beginning of the term; however, the minus sign must \nnot be followed by a space.\n\n      \n\n\nCaution!\n A minus sign within a word (\nused as a hyphen, such as e-learning or Fr\u00fddek-M\u00edstek\n) functions as a search for the exact term which also includes\n      diacritics and inflection in the search results.\n    \n\t \nstring with the '+' prefix\n\n\nIf you add a plus sign in front of the term so that there\n is no space separating them, the search results will include only \ndocuments with the exact term; in other words,\n      variations in inflection or diacritics will be ignored.\n      \n\n\nExample:\n If you search for the term \n+je\u017eka\n, the search results will include documents with the term \"je\u017eka\", but not \"je\u017eek\",\n      \"je\u017ekem\", \"jezek\" etc.\n     \npunctuation\n\n\nA punctuation mark divides the search term into \nindividual words. If the search string is a term without spaces and with\n one or more\n      punctuation marks, the search results will include documents which\n contain all the words of the search string in succession. Word forms \ncreated by\n      inflection or adding diacritics will also be included in the \nsearch results.\n      \n\n\nExample:\n If you use the string \nv\u011bda-v\u00fdzkum\n, the search results will include documents containing the forms of the word \"v\u011bda\" which are immediately\n      followed by the forms of the word \"v\u00fdzkum\", e.g. \"odd\u011blen\u00ed pro v\u011bdu, v\u00fdzkum a vn\u011bj\u0161\u00ed vztahy\".\n      \n\n\nlimiting results to a specific section\n\n\nIf the search term yields too many results, try limiting the search\n      to a specific section. You can find the section specification below the search field for fulltext search.\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]\n Limiting the search to a specific area.\n\n\n\n",

                "answer": "IS MU offers two options for more secure access to the system. The first option is \n\"Two-factor account verification\"\n,\n which will allow you to protect your account in the IS with both a \npassword and the national identification portal identitaobcana.cz.\nIt will then not be enough to simply enter the password to log in to the\n system, but it will always be necessary to prove your identity via the \nmentioned portal (using a chip card, e-citizen, e-government mobile key \nor via the My ID application). This feature will make it significantly \nmore difficult for attackers to try to solicit their passwords from \nusers in various ways (via phishing, etc.), because it will take two \nsteps instead of one to log in to the system.\n\n\nThe second option is the setting \n\u201eOther primary password for other systems\u201c\n,which\n will prevent the primary password from being taken over for other \nsystems in addition to the  IS MU itself. This option gives users a tool\n to take more control of their passwords. The \u201ePrimary password to the \nMU\u201c will then be used only for logging in to the IS MU and will not be \npassed on. The \"other primary password\" will be used in the so-called \nsingle login at MU for example to log in to an e-attendance, the SUPO \ndormitory payment system or to pre-order lunch in the canteen.\n\n\nBoth options can be set in the section:\n\n\nThe Information system \n System \n Change password\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed stupe\u0148 zabezpe\u010den\u00ed IS MU.\n\n",

Such a printed document is no longer signed, even \nthough \"nothing has disappeared\" from it.\n\n\nFor example, in the IS MU users will encounter an electronic certificate of studies that is signed with an electronic signature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n For example, students encounter an electronically signed document when generating a certificate of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n The user can see \nthat the document contains an electronic signature in the program in \nwhich the electronic documents are opened.\n\n",

A student enrolled in a course may register for only one \nexamination date. After the end of the date (at the time the examination\n date begins), he/she may register for the next one.\n            \nExamination room\nProvide an identification of the examination location that your students will understand.\n            \nLink the examination date to a series\n\n\nEach date must be assigned to a series, i. e. \ngroup of dates with certain parameters. By default, in the courses is a \nseries of \"zku\u0161ebn\u00ed term\u00edny\" (i. e. \"examination dates\") into which the \ndates are placed. If you want to create a new series, select \"---\" from \nthe menu and type its name (or other parameters) in the field that \nappears (if you already have a series, select it from the menu).\n             \nType of examination date \n \u2013 examination, resit \n(optional)\nThe terms may be marked as \"examinations \nonly (no resits)\", as \"resit\", \"both examination and resit\",  or left \nunmarked. Students may only apply for one date marked as \"examinations \nonly (no resits)\".

Only active students are counted in the reservation list. If a\n student's studies are interrupted or terminated, another student may \nenroll in his/her \"place\" during the period of inactivity. The problem \narises if the inactive student is reinstated or transferred to another \nstudy programme \u2013 the original enrolled place for the date remains. \nThese exceptions may cause a slight overcapacity for the term. If this \nis a problem for you, select the \"yes, leave the students who have \ninterrupte their studies on the list\" option.\n\nTip: Use this option only rarely\nThe\n option was introduced at the request of users, but we do not recommend \nusing it \u2013 we believe that extra students are less of an issue than \nunfulfilled date capacity (inactive students block the capacity of the \nterm).\n\n\nReserving a slot on the date\nStudents\n can reserve a slot from the moment the \"reservations for a slot on this\n examination date required\" option is set. It is usual to enable this \noption directly when creating the examination date and not to fill in \nthe \"open for reservations from\" field (see below). If there is no need \nto reserve a slot for the examination date (e.g. it is a common exam \nwhere all students have to come, or the teacher wants to reserve the \nslots \u2013 divide \u2013 the students by himself/herself), do not check the \n\"students should log in for this term\" option.\n\n    \nOpen reservation to \u2013 cancellation possible to\nClicking competitions\nIf\n it is necessary to run a time competition for students to get more \nconvenient dates, fill in the \"open for reservations from\" date. \nRegistration will open on this day from 17:00. If \"open for reservations\n from\" is filled in, then \"reservations for a slot on this examination \ndate required\" must also be checked. If \"open for reservations from\" is \nleft blank (recommended practice), there will be no student click \ncompetitions (students will not know exactly when reserving will start).\n\n\nYou can set \"open for reservations to\" and \"cancellation possible to\".\n\n",

I.e., using the \nActivate and deactivate capacity-limit sharing in the dates to be selected.\n. The examination date will then be listed in the form: \n\n      \nMon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123\n (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0, max. 40\n\nopen for reservations to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY, capacity-limit sharing enabled\n\n     In addition, teacher Y in course \nB\n  will create an examination date for students in course \nB\n. The maximum number of students for this examination date does not need to be set. \n\n      \nMon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123\n (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0\nopen for reservations to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY\n\n      Teacher Y then uses the application \nLink the capacity limit of an examination date of this course to a capacity limit of some other date\n. Teacher Y selects his term as the \nsecondary examination date\n  (on the first page of the application) and Teacher Y selects the term of teacher X's course \nA\nas the \nprimary examination date\n\n  (on the second page of the application). On the second side of the \napplication, all examination dates that are marked with the \n\"capacity-limit sharing enabled\" flag are offered, regardless of the \ncourse. \n      \n\n      Once Teacher Y has made this connection, it will be reflected in \nthe listing of both examination dates as follows.

A secondary \nexamination date cannot be a primary examination date and, conversely, a\n primary examination date term cannot be a secondary examination date. \n\n      \n\n      The resulting limit \u2013 the maximum number of students for a tuple \nof shared examination dates \u2013 is the limit specified for the primary \nexamination date. The limits specified for the secondary examination \ndate are ignored (after linking, the limit of the primary examination \ndate is displayed for the secondary examination date).

The examination date information line lists the sum of the\n number of students registered for all shared examination dates as the \nnumber of registered students, and always lists the limit of the primary\n examination date as the maximum number of students. \n      \n\n      If one individual (student) registers for both shared examination \ndates, he/she will be counted twice in the total number of registered \nstudents.

This means the making of an audio recording of the oral \nexamination on the examiner's technical medium or the making of a \nwritten record of the oral examination by the examiner.\n\n\nA repository is prepared in IS MU for these purposes, which teachers \ncan find directly in the Teacher application in the selected course in \nthe \"Detailed Information on a Student\" section under Examination dates:\n\n\nInformation System \n Teacher \n [selected course] \n (Students) \n Detailed Information on a Student\n \n [selected student] \n (Examination dates) \n Nahr\u00e1t z\u00e1znam ze zkou\u0161en\u00ed bez p\u0159\u00edtomnosti t\u0159et\u00ed osoby v p\u0159edm\u011btu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n Link to the repository for uploading a recording of an examination\n\n\n\n\nThe teacher uploads the recording simply by e.g. dragging and \ndropping it from their disk.

If a student makes a mistake on the sheet and \nthere is no corrections section, tear up the sheet and give thim/her a \nnew one to rewrite the information.\n\n\nEmphasize to the students to mark their answers using a bold \nline. Some students may try to cheat by marking answers they are unsure \nof very thinly, which the recognition program may interpret as an \nunanswered question. The student then waits and, if it was a correct \nanswer, requests a manual correction of the result. We therefore \nrecommend that teachers ignore claims of non-standard marked answers and\n leave the decision to the recognition program.\n\nFor handwritten examinations that will be scanned (i.e. answers\n are written on the answer sheet), warn students that they should not \nwrite in the margins of the paper and that \nonly\n answers on the face of the paper are scanned. The reverse side is not scanned and the student will not see it in IS.\n\nBefore handing in, ask students to check that they have not forgotten to fill in the assignment number.\n\nYou may or may not leave the assignment with the students, e.g.\n you can publish it to them at the end of the examination period by \ndisplaying the correct answers in ROPOT description in the IS (this does\n not apply to handwritten examinations, here you can post the assignment\n as a separate file, e.g. in the learning materials).\n\nTell students the date when they will see the grades, scanned answer sheets, or assignments in IS \u2013 save yourself questions.\n\n",

                "answer": "In\n exceptional cases, it may be useful to assign multiple seminar groups \nof students to a single capacity. For example, for some reason a course \nattended by students from more than one faculty is listed under its own \ncode in each faculty. The agenda allows you to set a fixed maximum \nnumber of students; the enrolments of students from all such linked \ngroups are added together. In addition to the limit, other data is \nevaluated for each group separately, i.e. different enrolment/departure \ndates, different lecturers, etc. can be set.\n\n        \nRecommended methodology for capacity sharing:\n        \nAfter the instructors have agreed that a certain \nexercise/seminar is to be run jointly for multiple groups, set the \ndesired limit for one of the groups and check the \"limit can be shared\" \nflag.\n         \nThe Information system \n Teacher \n [course selection]  \n (Seminar Groups) \n Work with groups\n\n        Using\n        \nThe Information system \n Teacher \n [course selection]  \n (Seminar Groups) \n capacity-limit sharing\n\n        Mark the other groups whose students are to be included in the \ncapacity. Link them to the appropriate group with the set limit. This \ncompletes the capacity sharing. If the exercise/seminar is no longer to \nbe shared between multiple groups, uncheck the capacity sharing (in the \ncapacity sharing application) and subsequently the \"limit can be shared\"\n flag (in Group handling). The sharing application always lists all \ncourses whose limit can be shared; unchecking the flag prevents someone \nfrom accidentally linking to your group and makes the listing clearer \nfor other teachers.\n\n\n        \nNote that in a credit-based learning system, effectively once\n a course has been taken, it should always be listed under a single \ncourse code, so this solution is an unadvisable compromise.\n        \nIt is possible to share multiple groups within a single \ncourse, multiple groups within multiple courses in a given faculty, or \nacross faculties. Follow-on groups must always all be assigned to the \nsame university time period (semester).\n        ",

The first is the Abbreviation. This is used to internally\n identify the file or folder when creating an Internet address that \nreferences the file or folder. If the abbreviation is not filled in, the\n IS will automatically generate the abbreviation. The second optional \nfield is Description. In this field you can write additional information\n about the folder, e.g. for which study materials the folder is \nintended. In addition, you can create multiple folders at once by simply\n clicking the Another Folder button using the Create New Folder option. \nAfter filling in one or more names and clicking the OK button, the \nfolder (or folders) will be created in the currently open Study \nMaterials folder.\n\u00a8\n\n\nUploading study materials from a computer\n\n\nThe file (or multiple files) can be uploaded to the study materials folder in two basic ways.\n\n\nYou can upload a new file by clicking the\n          \n\n icon in the top tool menu above the contents of the currently opened folder and clicking the Upload Files \n          \n icon.\n          If the user has \"More options\" turned on in File Manager, \nhe/she will see the Add menu expanded and can add files simply by \nclicking on the Upload Files\n          \n icon.\n\nWhen clicked, a dialog box opens with a Select files button. After \nclicking this button, the user needs to select one or more files from \nthe user's computer. If the user wishes to upload the files to the study\n materials under a different name than they are stored on his/her \ncomputer, he/she must click on the Rename \n\n          \n icon.\n\tThe optional fields Name, Name of file and Description can be filled in\n here. If the Name field is not filled in, the file will be saved under \nthe same name under which it is uploaded from the computer.\n\n\nThe second way to upload files from your computer to your \nstudy materials is by using the Drag&Drop feature. In this case, \nsimply \"drag and drop\" the selected files from your computer into the \ncurrently open folder box in the user's browser window. This procedure \nwill then bring up the Upload files application window itself, where the\n currently dragged files will already be selected. It is then possible \nto proceed as with the first method of uploading files.\n\n\nUploading a large number of files or a folder tree with materials\n\n\nIf the user wants to publish a lot of materials or a whole \ntree of materials (e.g. from his/her website), it is necessary to \npackage these materials into one ZIP file. You can import files from a \nzipped file by clicking the\n\n          \n\nicon in the top tool menu above the contents of the currently opened folder and clicking the Extract ZIP\n          \n icon.\nIf the user has \"More Options\" turned on in File Manager, he/she will \nsee the Add menu expanded and can upload zipped files simply by clicking\n on the Extract ZIP \n\n          \n icon.\n\nFrom here, simply click on the Select File button and select the ZIP \nfile from your computer. A variety of options can also be set for how to\n unzip and upload a given ZIP file to your study materials.\n\n\nCopying study materials from another course\n\n\nStudy materials can also be filled by copying study \nmaterials from another course. For this function, you need to go to the \nfolder from which you want to copy the study materials, select the file \nor folder (or multiple files and folders) by checking the check-box in \nfront of the file name and then click the \n\n          button in the right toolbar. A new window will then open in \nwhich you need to enter the address in the IS to which the files are to \nbe copied. This can be done either by typing in the exact address or by \nsearching for the appropriate folder using the Find button. The actual \ncopying is done by clicking on the OK button. In case the user wants to \ncopy all study materials in a given course, it is preferable to use the \nappropriate copying application in the Teacher agenda. In the case of \ncourses where it is desirable to share the material tree completely, it \nis preferable (rather than copying) to use the sharing application (the \nother course will not have its own material tree, both courses will have\n one common one). This application is again available in the\n\n\n          \nThe Information System \n Teacher \n [course selection] \n (Study Materials) \n Sharing and copying study materials",

Examples of allowed point value notations: \n\n\t  \n*23\n             *-14\n             *3.5\n\t     *8,2\n\n\nA scoring assessment\n beginning with asterisk can appear anywhere within the text, e.g. it is allowed: \n\n\t  \nThe 1st example was worse *3.5, the 2nd was better *8 and the *third* was the best *100!\n\n\t  If you enter multiple point values in one content, they are always \nadded together first before being used again. The values 3.5, 8, and 100\n are selected from the example line for addition purposes (so the sum is\n 111.5). Numbers not immediately preceded by an asterisk are ignored \nwhen processing points; likewise, asterisks not immediately followed by a\n digit, minus sign, period, or comma are ignored. \n\n    \n\n\nNegative\n numbers and \ndecimal\n \nnumbers are allowed. Decimal numbers must contain a decimal point or a \ndecimal comma. Often, rounding to two decimal places occurs in the \nsubsequent processing of decimal numbers. \n\n    \n\n    The application loads the specified notebooks either in their \nentirety or only a limited list of studies. It only processes content \nthat contains at least one score (the number after the asterisk). If \nmore than one score is found in the content, then they are added \ntogether before use. From the values found, an overview statistic is \ncalculated, or a graph is displayed according to the user's \ninstructions. \n\n    \n\n\nTip: Bulk addition of asterisks\nYou can also insert asterisks in front of selected numbers in the notebook using the application.\n\n\nThe Information system \n Teacher \n [course selection] \n (Notebooks) \n (Content) \n Add asterisks\n\n",

This file must retain the student and \ncourse identification column. Importing into a notebook will \nirreversibly overwrite the existing data in the notebook. \n\n      \n\n      When outputting from Excel, it is necessary to select the \ntab-delimited text\n output format. The Excel workbook will not be accepted by the application. \n\n      \n\n      You can have a notebook of just one name in one file, even if it \nbelongs to multiple courses at the same time. However, when importing a \nfile, you must first select all (or more) courses that appear in the \nfile. That is, you must have the courses into which the contents will be\n imported listed in the page header. If you don't have any there, you \nwill probably get an error message \"You don't have permission to the \ncourse\". \n\n      \n\n      When importing a file, only some columns are read. Columns are \nseparated by tab or colon (:). They are numbered from one. Two or more \ncolumns are relevant for import. The first mandatory column is the \nidentification string\n.\n      \n        It contains a unique identifier associating the evaluation with \nthe course, the period, the individual, his/her study and the course \nenrolment. This data must not be changed in the process of processing \nthe assessment outside the IS. The first number of the identification \nstring is the student's u\u010do and the second is the course code. The \nidentification string contains some extra data in order to recognize an \ninadvertent change of the identification string as an error. In the form\n above, you must set the sequence number of the identifier column. If \nyou do not fill it in, it will be an error. The pre-filled column number\n value corresponds to the column number where the identifier is inserted\n by the export application. \n\n      \n\n     The second mandatory column is the \ncontent\n  \ncolumn. You can specify more than one content column number if you are \nprocessing the exported notebook in Excel and you have your own data in \nmultiple columns.
