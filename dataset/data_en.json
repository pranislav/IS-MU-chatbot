You will be automatically registered and enrolled before\nthe start of the enrolment period (you will be ahead of regular\nstudents in the rankings).

        "answer": "If the course is capacity limited, those students who have a\nsatisfactory ranking will be automatically enrolled. The current rank\nis listed in the \"Position\" column. The system uses the following\nrules to determine the rank order:\n\nAll those who have already enrolled in the course are ranked first\n(the Office for Studies may enrol the course regardless of the order). They have a ranking of 0. Their number can be found in the \"Numbers\".\n\nStudents who have to repeat the course are ranked second. For most\ncourses, these students are automatically registered by the system\nbefore registration begins (they are in good position), and for\ncourses offered each semester, before the enrolment period begins.\nTheir current number (i.e. those who do not yet have a passing grade)\ncan be found in the \"Repeating\" section. The number of repeaters\nincludes students who have registered for a course with a bad time\nstamp; this grade will automatically improve during the night.\n\nIn addition, priority is given to students who are actively\nstudying one of the \"the fields the course is directly associated\nwith\". You can find out if you have priority in the \"Preference\"\nsection. To find out how many applicants do and do not have priority, see the \"Numbers\" section.\nLast in the list are those students who are not studying the fields the course is directly associated with and are not repeating the course.\n\nInactive (e.g. interrupted) studies and studies with already awarded grades (e.g. recognised courses) are not included in the calculation.\n\nWithin these groups, the order is according to the time stamp assigned at registration. You can find your stamps under the \"More information\" link. If more than one record has the same time stamp, they are further\nsorted according to the record's internal identification in the\nsystem. For example, the time stamp is followed by 16/25, which means that it is the 16th of 25 time stamps created in that second.\n\nIf a student registers for the same course in more than one of his/her studies, the system will search for the course and change the time\nstamp to the best stamp found in all the registrations of that\nstudent. The change will not take effect until 24 hours following the registration of the course.\n\nHow can the achieved ranking change?\nIf the fields the course is directly associated with in the\ncatalogue change, a different number of students will be given\npriority.\nRepeat students will appear in the ranking (before the enrollment period begins) and will be automatically registered by the system.\nStudents with previously interrupted studies who were able to\nregister but whose ranking has not yet entered the calculation will be registered.\nThe office for studies will enrol a certain number of students\noutside the normal registration.\nA reduction in rank may occur if someone placed ahead of you\nunregisters because they no longer need to repeat the course or\nfinished (interrupts) their studies. This change can also occur if a\nstudent ahead of you had the course recognized (students with a\nrecognized course are not counted towards the course capacity).\n",

        "answer": "To cancel the obligation to repeat a course, use:\n\nThe Information System  Student  Start of Term  Apply for course-repetition exemption   I want to apply for course-repetition\nexemption\n\n\nThe Study and Examination Regulations impose the obligation to\nre-enrol in the earliest possible date a course that has been\nunsuccessfully completed.\n\nArticle 20(2) and (3) states\n\n(2) The dean is entitled to grant an exemption from the obligation to repeat an elective course under subsection 1 at the request of a student, filed via the IS MU no later than by the end of the period for changing enrolment in courses; elective courses for this purpose are considered also courses included in a compulsory group of courses enrolled after the requirements of the compulsory group of courses have been met.\n\n(3) An exemption under subsection 2 may be granted only for courses whose aggregate credit value is worth up to one-tenth of the minimum credit value of the studies.\n\nThis application informs you how many credits you have already used up by course-repetition exemption and allows you to submit a request to the office for studies for permission not to repeat the course.\n\nThe application will be processed (granted or denied) by the office for studies, and the system will inform you by e-mail.\nAs long as the request is not granted, your obligation to repeat the course continues. You may withdraw your application until it is processed.\n\nRequests to remove the obligation to repeat a course may be submitted no later than the end of the enrollment change period in the semester when the course is automatically re-enrolled due to failure.\n\nIf the request is granted, the course cannot be re-enrolled in the future.\n\nGrades for courses that are allowed to be unrepeated in a given term are not counted in the grade point average.\n\nIf you are in doubt about whether a course is an elective for you,\ncontact your office for studies.\nWarningThe application lists all failed courses, you need to assess which\nones are optional for you. You can only be exempt from\ncourse-repetition if the sum of the credit values does not exceed 10% of the minimum credit value of the study.\nFor the calculation of the minimum credit value of studies, the\nstandard period of study of the field of study is used, namely the\nlongest period of actively studied fields of study (if the student is actively studying more than one field of study). For one semester, 30 credits are counted towards the minimum credit value of studies.\n\nThe distinction between compulsory and optional courses is not yet\nimplemented in the system. Therefore, it is possible to submit a\nrequest for cancellation of the obligation to repeat even for courses\nthat are compulsory for you. You have to distinguish yourself whether\nthe course is compulsory or optional. The office for studies will\nrefuse the request to cancel a compulsory course, but you will be\nadding unnecessary work to the office for studies.

        "answer": "Red messages in the table of registered courses indicate problems and these courses will not be enrolled for you. Courses may be registered as problematic (red) for a variety of reasons.\nIf the reason is an unmet prerequisite (i.e., if a student has a good time stamp but has not met the prerequisite), then that student is blocking space in the course for other students with a problem-free registration but a worse time stamp.\nIf a student with a red registration meets the prerequisite at the time of course enrolment, the course will be enrolled with his/her time stamp.\nFor some reasons, a teacher may be asked to grant an exception/consent to enroll via the \"Apply for permission\" link found in the \"Registered courses\" section for each course.\n\n\n\n1 Exception request for a course with problematic registration.\n\n\nThis link is available during the course enrollment period and the\nenrollment change period. It is not available during the course\nregistration period. During this period, a number of registration\nissues are resolved (missing prerequisites, etc.), so requests for\nexceptions do not need to be submitted yet.\n\nThe application will offer a form for the text of the letter to the teachers of the course. Include in the letter the reasons why the teacher should grant you an exception or permission to enroll. To submit the request, click the \"Apply for permission and send email\" button.\nYou can withdraw the pending request again at the same\nlocation. The application will send an email to the teacher (or course guarantor or contact person, depending on who is responsible for handling exceptions).\nIf the change is such that your original red registration is white (the problem has been resolved), the teacher sees that it is unnecessary to consider the exception request. You can withdraw the application if you wish, but it is not necessary.\n\nSubmit your request for an exception in time for the teacher to\nrespond by the end of the enrollment change period. Otherwise, you\nwill not be enrolled in the course.\n\nIf the teacher clicks to grant the exception in the MU IS, the course will be automatically enrolled immediately.\n\nIn some cases, an exemption cannot be requested because the teacher may not grant it.

        "answer": "The following shows how to work with the Study Planner. This tutorial will be divided into several chapters - adding a semester, finding and adding courses, adding courses to semesters, and saving a plan.\n        \nAdding a semester\nThe first step a student has to take when creating a plan for his / her studies is to create the appropriate semesters that the student wants to plan. By default, there are several empty semesters in the application that match the standard length of the study. To create a new (next) semester, the student must click the + Add Semester button. This is located in the lower left corner of the Plan section (see screenshot in the previous question).\nWith the + Add Semester button, a student can add a number of semesters to plan. The default is to always add a semester following the last semester in the curriculum. If the student does not want to plan the next semester (eg if the student plans to interrupt studies for the given semester), he / she can change the semester to the required semester. This can be achieved by clicking on the pencil icon (change the study period) next to the name of the semester. Then a window will appear in which you can change the study period to the desired future semester. In case the student wants to combine 2 scheduled semesters into one, the procedure is as follows. First of all, the student chooses a semester whose content he wants to add to another semester. For this semester, he clicks again on the pencil icon next to the semester name. In a new window, he then selects the appropriate semester with which he wants to merge the current semester.\nSearch for courses\nAnother important step in the planning of studies is to find individual courses that the student is interested in and save them for later insertion into individual semesters. There are two basic ways to find semesters in the Study Planner.\nSearch for courses in the Course Catalog\nThe student can access the search using the Course Catalog by clicking on the Add Course button at the top of the right panel. Clicking this button opens a window with the Course Catalog. In the Catalog, a student can select a number of attributes to filter out the items that are displayed to him / her (eg by faculty and workplace, Period, Template or using the search window). After selecting the filters, the student must click the View button at the top of the window next to the search box. You will then see all the courses that match those filters. To select individual courses that the student wants to add to their plan, it is necessary to tick the checkboxes for each relevant course. A separate help for searching in the Course Catalog can be found in the relevant help..\nAfter selecting the first course, a new bar will appear with information on the number of selected courses with three buttons. The first button from the left is the Show button, which displays a new window with all courses in the current selection and allows you to deselect some courses or deselect all courses. The middle Cancel button allows you to cancel the entire selection. The last button Go to the application, then serves to return to the Study Planner and the selected courses will be transferred to the Saved courses section in the right panel (see chapter Adding a course to the semester).\nIn Control Templates\nThe second way a student can look for courses and add them to their study plan is to use Control Templates. These can be accessed by clicking on the Template Check button located in the right panel at the top. After clicking this button, the student will see a window with three tabs - Study Control Templates, Other Control Templates and Registration Templates. By default, the Student Control Templates tab appears. Here the student will find all the subjects that are linked to his / her currently chosen study. The courses are categorized hierarchically (typically Compulsory Courses, Compulsory Elective Courses or sets of courses according to possible study specializations). Students can open individual categories and choose from a range of courses. For more information, the student can click through (more) in the relevant course field. This function displays basic information for the course, such as the name of the faculty at which the course is taught, the way of completion, the language of instruction and the number of credits. For even more information about the course, the student can click on the course name, which will open the course syllabus in the Course Catalog. To add a course to the study plan, the student must click the button in the relevant course field. This button inserts the subject into Saved Courses (see Question Adding a Course to the Semester).\n\nInserting courses into semesters\nAfter selecting and saving courses in the study plan, all selected courses are saved in the Saved Courses section, located in the right panel. Saved courses always contain parentheses with a number representing the number of courses currently saved. Thus, this function acts as a certain stack of selected courses that the student can insert into individual semesters of the plan. If the student does not see all of the courses in the Saved Courses stack, you need to click the down arrow icon that appears after Saved Courses to expand the menu with all of the courses saved so far.\n\n         To add a course to a semester, you need to drag the course from the saved courses menu and paste it into the appropriate semester. After inserting the course in the semester, the course will be deleted from the saved courses. Newly, however, the course (in the upper right corner of the course) in the given semester may display a number of icons that signal further information about the course status (whether it is enrolled, completed, etc.) whether it conflicts with the planned study (eg whether there are any other problems with the possible registration (or enrollment) of the course (eg the course is not enrolled in the given semester). After inserting the courses into the semester, it is always advisable to save the curriculum, otherwise it may be lost (see Saving the curriculum).\nOverview of course status icons and their meaning:\n\n         The course has been successfully completed\n\n         The course was unsuccessfully terminated\n\n          The course is scheduled\n\n         The course is registered\n\n         The course is enrolled\n\n         Repeated course\n\n         The course can not be repeated\n\n         The course is offered in the given semester\n\n          The course is not offered for the term\n\n         Unfulfilled prerequisites for entering the course\nRemoving the course from the semester and removing the semesters\nIf a student wants to remove a course from a given semester or from the Saved Courses section, drag the course to the Trash icon. This is located in the right panel, in the same section as Saved Courses.\nIf the student wants to remove the entire scheduled semester, it is necessary to remove all courses from the given semester in the first step. After the scheduled semester empty, you need a plan to save again, leading to its deletion from the plan.\n\nSave study plan\nAfter planning the study, or any part of it (removing courses or semesters, saving selected courses, etc.), it is necessary to save the study plan. To save, click the Save icon at the top of the right panel. If a student fails to do so and leaves the Study Planner, student loses the entire unsaved study plan.\nChecking the conditions for the next semester\nWhen creating a plan and entering courses into individual semesters, the student also shows whether he / she has fulfilled sufficient conditions for progress to the next semester. The student can see this clearly in the field, which indicates the number of credits in the scheduled semester. If the icon containing the number of credits scheduled for a given semester is green, the students' plan is sufficient to advance to the next semester. Conversely, if the icon is colored red, the plan is insufficient and the student does not fulfill the conditions for progress to the next semester and should adjust their curriculum. If the icon is red (indicating that it is impossible to advance to the next semester), the student can click on it. Then he / she will see a new window in which he / she will have an overview of all the conditions for moving to the next semester and evaluating why in this particular semester his plan does not meet these conditions.\n\n1 Checking the conditions for the next semest.\n",

        "answer": "The study planner not only allows you to plan your studies, but also to check whether such a plan will be sufficient to successfully complete your studies. To control the passage of the study, the student can proceed in the application in two ways - by checking the passage of the study and by checking through the Control templates.\n\n        \nPassage through study\nThe student will find the basic check of the course through the study at the bottom of the right panel. The course of study is in the form of a table with individual semesters and the number of credits earned or planned. This function shows the student whether he / she will be able to move on to the next semester according to the set plan and whether he / she will meet the minimum credit value of his / her studies at the end of the plan.\n\nWarningPassing through the studies counts only the gain of credits and conditions for advancement to the next semester. It is not a decisive indicator of whether a student will be able to successfully complete this study because there are no distinctions between compulsory, compulsory, and elective courses.\nChecklist template\nThe second possibility for the student to check the successful completion of his / her studies is to use Control Templates. These can be accessed by clicking on the Template Check button located in the right panel at the top. After clicking this button, students will see a window with three tabs - Study Control Templates, Other Control Templates, and Registration Templates. By default, students will see the Study Control Templates tab. Here the student will find all the courses that are linked to his / her currently selected study. Another option is to use the Other Control Templates tab, by means of which the student can compare his / her study with Control Templates of other fields. The courses are divided into a tree structure (typically Compulsory Courses, Compulsory Elective Courses or sets of courses according to possible study specializations). The individual levels and parts of the Control template are then marked with a color bar on the left side of the respective level. Each color represents a different level of completion for that section:\nGreen – met (all subtree conditions met)\n          Orange – enrolled (all conditions of the subtree are met or courses are currently enrolled)\n          Red – unfulfilled (one of the subtree courses was unsuccessfully completed)\n          Blue – scheduled (all courses required to meet the subtree conditions are scheduled in the Study Planner)\n          Gray –  conditions not met and none of the previous cases apply\nIf the student has completed all courses (or other conditions such as the number of credits) required to fulfill the given level, the given level will remain collapsed. Students can use the Control Template to find out which compulsory parts of their studies have already been fulfilled and which courses they have to successfully complete. It is also possible to add the courses to the curriculum using the Control Template function (see Inserting courses into semesters).\nWarningControl templates may not always match the real study requirements. Please take control of your study using the Control Templates with reserve. The final decision to meet all study requirements is always within the competence of your study department.",

This principle is referred to in the English-language literature as \"peer assessment\".\n\t\n\tUnlike the more familiar \"peer review\", where assessors are selected from among experts in the field to provide a qualified and impartial assessment \n    of the submitted research, in the case of peer assessment, assessors are selected at the discretion of the teacher, typically from among the students. \n    Thus, submitters and assessors often come from the same group of people.\n\t\n\tBy assessing your peers' work, you get an insight into the way your classmates think about the assignment, which can inspire you to gain a new perspective \n    or deeper understanding of the topic at hand. Therefore, be in solidarity and strive to provide quality and constructive feedback even in the case of verbal \n    comments.

        "answer": "\n        Students are typically informed by the teacher about participation in the peer assessment, similar to other activities in the course. If set up, the \n        application sends emails to submitters or assessors about their role in the peer assessment. The information emails include all relevant information \n        related to the assessment.\n        \n\tAll the peer assessments that are assigned to you in a particular semester can be found via:\n\tInformation System  Student  Teaching  Peer assessment\n\n\n1 Link to the application from the Student agenda.\n\n\tPeer assessments are displayed differently depending on the role of the person in a particular assessment.\n\t\nThe submitter is a student of the course or seminar group with the right to submit to at least one homework vault that is attached to the peer \n    assessment. If the submitter submits at least one file on time to at least one linked homework vault, the file (or files) so submitted will be included \n    in the distribution and subsequently assigned to the assessor. If submitters are grouped, it is sufficient if at least one file is submitted on time by \n    at least one member of the group, as it is assumed to be a file produced by the whole group.\n\t\nThe assessor can be a student of the course, seminar group or a person specified by the UIN (učo). When distributed, assessors are assigned to submitters \n    whose files they assess via an assessment form. If student assessors are allocated to groups, they will always have one assessment form for the whole group per \n    each submitter. Even in this case, it is sufficient for a single member to enter the assessment, as it is assumed that the assessment is by the whole group.\n\t\n\tAssessors, as well as submitters, are determined at the discretion of the teacher, who also determines how many submitters a single assessor gets to assess. \n    In special cases, the teacher of the course in which the peer assessment is located may also be the submitter or assessor.",

This is called pseudonymity, which ensures that the name or the UIN \n    (učo) of the assessor or submitter is not displayed anywhere in the application and the submitted files are renamed so that they cannot be linked to the file \n    name in the homework vault. However, the Peer Assessment application does not delete metadata from the submitted files or check their content. Therefore, if \n    the submitter signs directly into their work or leaves metadata in the file (e.g., the author of a Word document), even with pseudonymity set, the assessor can \n    still find out the identity of the submitter in peer assessment.\n\t\n\n1 Information about (non-)concealment of identity\n\n\tCourse teachers always know the identity of submitters and assessors.",

V případě jednofázového režimu se Evaluace skládá ze tří\nodpovědníků. Jeden odpovědník vyplňuje student,   druhý provázející učitel.\n Po odevzdání všech tří odpovědníků jsou\nodpovědníky sloučeny do jednoho výsledného odpovědníku, který si student\nzobrazí a získá tak zpětnou vazbu na svoji praxi.

        "answer": "automatic enrollment\nThe module performing the automatic enrollment is started one day before the start of enrollment period (or that of enrollment changes) and terminated one day after its end. Every night, it checks the students' registration records as well as their applications for changing the type of course completion. Provided the student's registration has been successful, it is confirmed and the student is enrolled in the course.\n     \nThe automatic application is terminated one day after the end of the period\n      registration / registration changes.\n\n   study mode\nthe way the student studies (attends classes) \n       full-time\nThe student attends lectures, seminars, etc.\n         distance\nThe student maintains a limited contact with his/her teacher. This mode is chiefly based on self-study.\n         combined\nThis mode entails both the full-time mode and the distance one. Besides doing a lot of self-study, the student in this mode, for instance, consults his/her teacher once a month.\n         lifelong\nThis mode is typical of lifelong learning programmes.\nterm\nStudent applications are run under individual terms named after the seasons during which they are under way (e.g. Autumn 2024). Each of these has its Term Calendar delineating the registration period, enrollment period, period of enrollment changes, teaching period, seminar-group-enrollment period, examination period, and extended examination period. The Term Calendar also lists the date on which timetable is to be released.\n\n  repeated course\nIf the student does not complete the course (if he / she does not obtain a successful grade), he / she must obtain it\n      re-enroll in the next semester, when the course is listed.\n      Repeatedly unsuccessful completion of the course is a reason to terminate the study. Unsuccessfully repeated\n      subjects are controlled by the study department.\n\n   pre-requisites\na term referring to the conditions that have to be met for a student to be able to enroll in a course.\n\n  enrollment problems\nThe Course Catalogue specifies the so-called course enrollment pre-requisites. Provided the student meets these, his/her registration is successful and his/her registration record is marked white whereas if he/she does not (meet these), his/her registration is marked red. However, the unsuccessful registration may also result from some other factors than just a failure to meet the enrollment pre-requisites. The most frequent causes of registration problems are as follows:\n         The course is full and there are no longer any vacancies in it.\n          The course enrollment pre-requisites have not been met.\n          The course is only offered to students of certain fields.\nregistration wave\na period during which students of a certain category are allowed to begin to register for courses\n\n  state of study\nA recorded event that may occur in the studio, eg enrollment in the study,\n         interruption of studies, etc. If the study has an active state on a certain date,\n         we say it is active on that date. Many operations in the IS can be performed only by a person\n         who now has an active study. Related terms are inactive study\n         (the student has interrupted his studies, from the point of view of the Czech Republic he is not a student), completed studies\n         and successfully completed studies.\n         \n        The state of study of the field is also registered. It is possible, for example, one of the two studied\n        interrupt the disciplines and continue in the second.\n\n\n  field (of study)\nThe field is usually subsumed under one or more degree programmes. The student usually enrolls in one or more fields (single-subject x double-subject studies) within one degree programme. Provided he/she enrolls in a combination of fields that belong to the same degree programme (double-subject studies) and are offered by different faculties, his/her studies are referred to as interfaculty. The information recorded with such a programme is its code, name, and abbreviated name.\n\n  degree programme\nan area of studies. Faculties offer degree programmes, which are divided into fields (of study). Applicants always select a degree programme and one or more of its fields. The degree programmes offered by Masaryk University are as follows:\n      Bachelor's degree programme\na three- to four-year programme; pre-requisite for being allowed to enroll: completed secondary school studies; Bc. (Bachelor's) degree conferred at its completion\n       Master's degree programme\na five- to six-year programme; pre-requisite for being allowed to enroll: completed secondary school studies; Mgr. (Master's) or Ing. degree conferred at its completion\n       Master's degree programme (following the Bachelor's one)\na two- to three-year programme; pre-requisite for being allowed to enroll: completed Bachelor's degree programme; Mgr. (Master's) or Ing. degree conferred at its completion\n       doctoral degree programme\na three-year programme; pre-requisite for being allowed to enroll: completed Master's degree programme; Ph.D. (doctoral) degree conferred at its completion\n       advanced ('rigorózní') programme\nan advanced ('rigorózní') procedure programme\n       lifelong learning programme\na programme in which no degree is conferred at its completion; students may switch into the Bachelor's degree programme after some time\n     The information recorded with every degree programme is its code, name, abbreviated name, type, and standard length of studies in it. To browse this information, please use the following path:\nInformační systém  Studium  Programy, obory, směry\nstatus of studies\ninformation about the current status or ongoing event related to studies such as enrollment, interruption of studies, etc. Students who interrupt or terminate their studies lose access to a wide range of applications the Information System offers. Related terms: interrupted studies, terminated studies, completed studies\n\n   personal identification number (učo)\na unique string assigned to every IS user, which is used to identify him/her; Even if a student interrupts and then resumes his/her studies, he/she can still use the same identification number. It is also the student's status of studies in the field that is recorded since he/she may interrupt his/her studies in one while staying enrolled in the other.\n\n   completion of course\nThe course is offered with one or more types of completion (eg exam, colloquium). Depending on the completion of the course, the student will be awarded the appropriate grade.\n         The recommended completion is the one that students implicitly register.\n     \n     \n         Other possible –  it may be possible to enroll in the course with varying difficulty (completion).\n         What course endings exist and their ratings can be found at\n         \nThe Information system  Courses  Types of completion and evaluation\nenrollment period\na period delineated by the Term Calendar during which successful registration is confirmed and students are enrolled in the courses they have previously registered for\n\n  period of registration changes\na period delineated by the Term Calendar during which successful registration is confirmed and students are enrolled in the courses they have previously registered for; Unlike the enrollment period, this one is usually under way during the first two weeks of a term. During the period of enrollment changes, the IS applications used for registration and enrollment work the same way as they do during the enrollment period.\n\n\n   permission/exception application\nIf a student fails to meet the course enrollment pre-requisites, he/she cannot succeed in registering for the course. In such a situation, he/she can apply for being granted the permission to enroll in the course with its teacher.\n",

The last day for filing an appeal is always the\n30th day after the date of delivery of the decision. If this last day falls on a non-business day, the student may still submit the appeal on the first following business day.\nDetails of the appeal can be obtained by each student from the study department of the relevant faculty. The student is required to explain and document the reasons for his/her request. When considering a student's request for a fee waiver or reduction, the student's academic performance, social situation of the family, health reasons, participation in a study abroad or representation of Masaryk University are taken into account. It is not necessary to document the data that can be found in the IS MU.\n\nThe obligation to pay the assessed fee does not cease even if the student ceases to study at MU during the period for which the fee was assessed. If the student wishes to have this circumstance taken into account, he or she must also apply for a fee reduction or waiver within the statutory time limit, even if it is uncertain at the time of the application whether the termination or interruption of studies will take place at all. In such a case, the proceedings will be stayed after the appeal has been lodged until the student has actually completed or interrupted his/her studies (or until it is clear that he/she will not). \n\nIf a student misses the 30-day deadline, this delay may be excused for very serious and documented reasons,  that objectively prevented the student from submitting the application on time.

The decision to allocate a standard instalment plan is simpler and quicker. \n\n\nThe student can also request an individual repayment plan,to allow for any exceptions and individual entitlements.

The MU Information System takes into account information about the person and the person's studies at MU. Information on a person's studies at other universities in the Czech Republic is taken from the student register. The subject of the examination are studies covered by the above-mentioned Higher Education Act. These are studies which took place at least one day after 1 January 1999. This means that the period of studies (successfully, unsuccessfully) concluded before 1999 is not included in the calculation. The duration of studies that started before 1999 and continued afterwards are included in the calculation in full. Only bachelor's and master's degrees are included in the calculation. Doctoral studies shall not be assessed a fee, nor shall the time spent therein be taken into account when calculating the fee for other studies. \n\n\nData from the student register  is taken twice a year. The study departments of individual MU faculties have the option of adding so-called correction records,\n to the student record records, which have higher validity and replace the original student record records when calculating fees. In the same way, the study department can also add other studies of a foreign school. However, the corrective record is deleted the next time the data is collected from the national student record, so it is always better to resolve discrepancies in the data at another university at that university, which is the only one that can also correct its data for the national student record.

The vice-dean also makes decisions on students’ requests concerning the studies. The administrative tasks related to studies are the responsibility of the Office for Studies. The records of inter-faculty studies of a student are kept by the faculty where the student is enrolled. Students are obliged to follow the internal regulations of the faculty and in case of any uncertainties to consult the Office for Studies of their faculty. See  Offices for studies (muni.cz). Matters related to the content of degree programmes (e.g. programme specification, study plan, assessment of concordance of the course contents in the process of recognition of courses taken, setting conditions in the Course Catalogue) are usually dealt with by the guarantor of the degree programme.

        "answer": "(1) The academic year has a duration of twelve months divided into an autumn and a spring semester, beginning on 1 September and 1 February respectively. Each semester includes at least one week designated for enrolment in the semester, no less than three weeks for course enrolment, no less than twelve and no more than fifteen weeks of teaching time and at least six weeks of examination period, so that:\nthe examination period does not overlap with teaching while ending at least one day prior to the last day of the period designated for enrolment in the next semester,\n\tthe period designated for enrolment in the semester ends no later than on the fifth working day following the first day of teaching in that semester,\n\tthe course enrolment period ends on the thirteenth calendar day following the first day of teaching in that semester with the possible exception of intensive and/or specially scheduled courses; enrolment regulations for such courses are specified by the dean in the public section of the relevant website,\n\tthe course registration period precedes the course enrolment period.\nThe remainder of the semester constitutes vacation time.\nExplanationThe term “course enrolment” differs from “enrolment in a semester”. The terms “enrolment in studies” and “re-enrolment in studies” also have a different meaning.\nEnrolment in studies – the faculty sends an invitation to enrolment by email or inserts it directly to the e-application.\nEnrolment in the next semester is made during a defined period electronically via an application in the IS MU. Applications for enrolment in the next semester may be submitted and confirmed even after the classes in the given semester have started.\nIf the student has two or more concurrent studies, enrolment is made for each of the studies separately. By submitting an application for enrolment in the next semester, the student expresses their will to continue in the studies.\nExamination period is a period of time to which examiners schedule the dates of course completion. It must not happen that no completion date of a particular course is scheduled during the exam period. The beginning and end of the exam period are clearly determined by the academic year schedule, in accordance with the provision of Section 3(1)(a). The possibility of completing a course outside the exam period is not excluded, depends, however, on the examiner. The examiner may schedule the course completion dates before the beginning as well as after the end of the exam period in accordance with Section 16; however, they are not obliged to do so.\nCourse enrolment – within a defined period (the period of course registration and course enrolment – see Section 11), the student electronically (via an IS MU application) applies for courses they have chosen to study in the next semester. This is course registration. The IS MU checks whether the requirements for enrolment in the respective courses have been met and, after potential shortcomings are corrected, automatically confirms the student’s enrolment in such courses.\nWhen the student attempts to register a course, problems may arise that could prevent course enrolment (e.g. requirements not met, capacity exceeded, enrolment in a course not permitted for the given studies etc.).

        "title": "Section 6 – Credit System",
        "answer": "(1) The fulfilment of study requirements in a programme (hereinafter referred to as “studies”) is recorded by means of a credit system based on the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS).\n(2) The basic unit of studies is a course identified by a unique course code. The amount of requirements necessary to complete a course is expressed by the number of credits assigned to that course (hereinafter referred to as the “credit value”).\nExplanationEach course taught at MU faculties has a unique identification code. Although the contents of certain courses may be very similar, in academic records they are considered to be different courses.\n(3) The credit value of a course, group of courses or stage of studies is determined in accordance with ECTS principles so that it corresponds to a standard workload of an average student; it is used for a course regardless of a programme or study mode.\nExplanation1 ECTS = 25–30 study hours.\n60 ECTS represents a workload necessary for one year of full-time studies (30 ECTS per semester).\nA course with a particular code can be prescribed for students of different degree programmes implemented at different faculties. However, its credit value cannot vary according to a programme the student pursues (the only way credit value may vary is determined by different manners of course completion, if admissible).\n(4) A condition for the completion of studies in a programme or field of study is the acquisition of credits awarded for completing courses prescribed by the study plan, reaching at least the minimum credit value, i.e. thirty times the standard duration of study in a programme expressed in the number of semesters.\nExplanationThe composition of a set of courses necessary for due completion of studies is prescribed by the degree programme and forms a part of accreditation documents. Students will find the information in study templates for the course of studies in the IS MU. The standard duration of study of some programmes in the combined mode is longer than that of programmes in the full-time mode, even though the programmes may have the same or similar contents. The minimum credit value of such programmes is identical and equals the minimum credit value of the full-time programme or, as the case may be, the minimum credit value calculated using the shortest standard duration set by law for the relevant programme type. For example, a master’s degree programme in the combined mode was accredited as three-year and in the full-time mode as two-year; the minimum credit value of either is 120.\n(5) For the purpose of assessing the minimum credit value of studies, the following credits are recognized:\ncredits gained for courses completed during the studies,\n\tcredits recognized in accordance with Section 14,\n\tcredits automatically recorded in accordance with Section 14(10),\n\tcredits recognized in accordance with Section 60(2) of the Act, from credits gained for courses completed within lifelong learning.\nExplanationAll courses enrolled and completed, courses recognized, automatically recorded or transferred are listed in the diploma supplement together with credits gained or recognized (the diploma supplement under Section 57(1)(f) of the Act is issued separately for each of the successfully completed studies). If the studies were not successfully completed, the courses enrolled and completed, courses recognized, automatically recorded or transferred are listed in the transcript of records, which is issued by the Office for Studies together with the certificate of study pursuant to Section 57(5) of the Act.\n(6) Credits gained for courses identical or substantially overlapping with courses for which the student has already gained credits in these studies shall not be recognized and included in the credit value.\nExplanationIt is not permissible to accumulate credits for courses with identical contents. The restriction of the student’s right to register and enrol in such courses is achieved through the so-called prerequisites. An IS MU application does not allow enrolment in course X if it is encoded in its prerequisites that enrolment in course X is prevented by the completion of course Y in the past.\n(7) At the request of a student, the dean is entitled to decide on a repeated completion of a course provided its content significantly differs during each implementation of the course. In such case, the repeated completion is not considered course repetition under Section 20.\nExplanationA typical example is a PE course.",

In case a student is enrolled in multiple studies simultaneously, these are considered as concurrent studies.\nExplanationA study template is useful when the student wants to check their course of studies (whether the conditions for admittance to the final state examination have been met).\n(2) The Office for Studies of a given faculty shall provide a student or former student, at their request, with a transcript of courses completed in accordance with Section 57(1)(b) and Section 57(3) of the Act, in the form of a transcript of records kept in accordance with subsection 1.\n(3)\tThe examiner, the chair of the examination board or other authorized person are responsible for entering the result of course completion into the IS MU:\nno later than on the working day following the day when the course is completed by oral examination, or\n\tno later than seven working days after the date of course completion in case the last part of the course completion is a written assignment or another form of instruction in that course.\nExplanationThe wording “no later than seven working days after the date of course completion” means that the examiner must enter the assessment into the IS MU on the seventh day after the completion, at the latest. E.g., if a written examination is held on Thursday, the assessment must be entered by Monday midnight of the week after next.\nIn the case of an oral examination, the assessment must be entered on the following working day at the latest.",

        "answer": "(1)\tCourses and groups of courses included in programmes implemented at MU and its faculties are classified as either compulsory, selective or elective. The type of a course is determined individually in respect of a specific study plan.\nExplanationCourse X may be compulsory in studies A, selective in studies B and not specified in studies C; therefore it is an elective course in studies C.\n(2)\tA course may be implemented in a language different from the language of a given programme if so stipulated by the course specification.

        "answer": "(1)\tTeaching and supervision of diploma theses are entrusted to academic employees. Teaching and supervision of diploma theses may also be entrusted to experts meeting the rules adopted by the faculty scientific board or to other persons approved by the faculty scientific board.\n(2)\tThe teaching may be delivered face-to-face, online as synchronous teaching, or as guided self-study in an asynchronous mode. Direct teaching means the face-to-face teaching or synchronous online teaching or a combination thereof.\nExplanationDirect teaching in the full-time study mode is primarily carried out face to face; in justified cases specified by MU methodology, it may be replaced by synchronous online teaching. Studies in the full time mode may also include asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study. The use of remote teaching activities in the full-time study mode is regulated by Section 22 of MU Directive No. 1/2024.\nThe teaching in the distance study mode is delivered mainly through asynchronous methods, i.e. guided self-study. Distance study mode may also include direct teaching delivered face to face or through synchronous online methods. The scope and proportion of asynchronous and direct teaching and the method of communication with the teacher, as well as between the students themselves, is defined during the process of degree programme accreditation.\nThe teaching in the combined study mode is delivered through the combination of direct and asynchronous teaching, i.e. guided self-study. The proportion of face-to-face teaching and synchronous online teaching is defined during the process of degree programme accreditation. Bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes in the combined study mode include at least 80 lessons of direct teaching per semester, except for the last semester of studies, in which focus is on writing the final thesis if mandatory in the degree programme.\n(3)\tFull-time students are required to participate in the instruction with the exception of lectures and consultations. Participation in other forms of instruction may be substituted with other requirements if so stipulated in the course specification. The obligation of students in the combined study mode to be present in the classes is determined in the course specification.\n(4)\tClasses during a semester are organized according to weekly timetables or within the framework of intensive courses.\n(5)\tThe methods of assessment, manner of course completion and other information on the requirements for the course completion are announced by the teacher via the IS MU at least five working days before the start of the classes.\nExplanationThe purpose of this measure is to ensure that the teacher is able to prove, in the event of a later dispute, that they issued an organizational instruction. Teachers may use the tools at their discretion; send emails (copies of which are stored in the study materials), post to an interactive syllabus or discussion forum; fill in lasting instructions in the course annotation.\n(6)\tIn case course completion involves online examination, the teacher announces via the IS MU the manner and procedure of online examination including conditions, requirements and instructions concerning technology, at least five working days before the start of the classes.\n(7)\tA student is entitled to one unexcused absence from compulsory classes within a course; this does not apply to intensive courses or specially scheduled courses under subsection 4. This shall not affect study obligations arising from in-term assessments or other mandatory conditions associated with the course. If the conditions of the course teaching and study allow so, the course guarantor may set a higher number of unexcused absences permitted.\nExplanationUnexcused absences will not be allowed if the student is to go through in-term assessment in a course or to meet any other obligation that cannot be repeated or made up for. In such cases, an absence must be duly excused.\n(8)\tA student is obliged to excuse their absence from compulsory classes via the IS MU within five working days after the classes take place.",

        "answer": "(1)\tThe right to participate in a course and in other study-related activities necessary for its completion arises to a student solely through the course enrolment.\n(2)\tIn the period for course registration and subsequently in the period for course enrolment, a student, via the IS MU, chooses the courses planned to be attended in the next semester. Course enrolment shall be carried out unless prevented by an obstacle under these Regulations.\nExplanationDepending on the programme, the student may be obliged in the first semesters of studies to enrol in certain courses in accordance with the recommended study plan. Enrolment in a course is only valid if confirmed by the relevant IS MU application. Course enrolment is automatically confirmed on a daily basis, however, at the latest on the first day after the end of the period for enrolment as determined by the academic year schedule.\nThe semester schedule sets the period for registration, period for enrolment and period for changing enrolment in courses. The student is allowed to choose (register) and cancel (deregister) courses during all the three periods. When choosing the courses, the student will search for course codes or use the offer in the template. Any course scheduled for the given semester at any MU faculty may be registered. Course registration takes place at different times at various faculties, according to the faculty semester schedule. In case the student meets the conditions described in the Course Catalogue, the course registration will be smooth (marked in white), in the opposite case, it will be marked in red. During the period of enrolment and enrolment changes, problem-free courses are confirmed, i.e. the student is enrolled, each night (all changes typically take place before the start of the semester and in the first two weeks of the semester). By enrolment in a course, the student becomes entitled and obliged to study that course.\nThe IS MU will enrol (confirm) courses only for active studies (e.g. those that have not been interrupted). The student may, however, register courses also if the studies have been interrupted. The Office for Studies may both register and enrol courses regardless of whether the studies are active or not.\nThe student may choose (register/enrol) only courses scheduled for the period of the academic year to which the student registers/enrols. The student may not register/enrol a course to the spring semester if such a course is only taught in autumn semesters.\n(3)\tA student is entitled to register and enrol in courses whose credit value does not exceed 60 credits in one semester for each of the student’s studies.\nExplanationThe registration of courses for a given semester in the IS MU is an expression of the student’s wish to take and complete the courses in the given semester. Early registration allows the student to be guaranteed a “place” in courses that are limited in capacity and can be expected to be in high demand. Information about the number of students who will be completing courses in the examination period of a given semester or attending classes during the semester is displayed to the teacher in the IS MU Teacher’s Notebook. After the registration, timetables of classes are prepared. The student may apply for enrolment in courses in the period for enrolment. In case the capacity of the course has been exceeded, the student cannot take the course in the given semester.\n(4)\tFor the purpose of preparing the timetable or an offer of courses, the dean is entitled to decide on the obligation to register a course before the period for course registration and enrolment; this does not apply to registration immediately following enrolment or re-enrolment in studies.\nExplanationIn the event that not enough students have registered a course, it may happen that the course will not be taught. The registration duty does not apply to students who enrol in courses in the first semester of their studies and students who enrol in courses immediately after re-enrolment in studies following an interruption.\n(5)\tThe dean is entitled to limit the number of students enrolled in a course. In such case, the guidelines for prioritization of students are set, giving preference to students for whom the course is compulsory, selective or repeated (Section 20) and those who have registered the course.\nExplanationThe starting date of course registration for a certain group of students is defined by so-called registration waves. Registration waves only start on working days. The beginning of the registration is distributed into five waves, in which growing numbers of students may register.\nThe “remaining credit volume” is used to determine the order in which individual groups of students may register. This is the number of credits the student has to gain to reach the total required for the completion of their studies within a programme. The remaining credit volume is the difference between the minimum credit value of the studies (i.e. the standard duration of study in semesters multiplied by 30) and the number of credits gained so far that have been included in the total of the programme studied, including credits for recognized courses (if the result is negative, it is treated as zero).\nThe first registration wave: from the moment of the beginning of registration at a given faculty, those students whose remaining credit volume is lower than 61, plus all doctoral students are allowed to register.\nThe second registration wave: from the moment following two working days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose remaining credit volume is lower than 121 are also allowed to register.\nThe third registration wave: from the moment following four working days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose remaining credit volume is lower than 181 are also allowed to register.\nThe fourth registration wave: from the moment following six working days after the beginning of the registration, those students whose remaining credit volume is lower than 241 are also allowed to register.\nThe fifth registration wave: from the moment following eight working days after the beginning of the registration, all students will register.\nIn case a student is enrolled in concurrent studies, the remaining credit volume is calculated separately for each of the studies; the student also registers courses separately in each of the studies.\nThe numbers of credits gained are usually calculated at night. However, if the student was given assessment immediately before the start of a registration wave and they need the credits to be admitted to the registration wave, the student may use the application for recalculating the credits.\n(6)\tFurther conditions for enrolment in registered courses including the requirement of prior completion of other courses may be determined in the programme specification or the Course Catalogue, as the case may be.\n(7)\tChanges in course enrolment are only possible during the period designated for course enrolment and its change; this does not apply to enrolment in intensive or specially scheduled courses; special guidelines for such courses are set by the dean.\nExplanationThis right only arises when enrolment in the next semester is confirmed (Section 12).\nThe rules on which course enrolment depends are called prerequisites. They define study obligations to be fulfilled for the student to be enrolled in a course. The student cannot enrol in a course unless these prerequisites have been met. If the student meets the prerequisites for enrolment in a course in one study and has the course registered or enrolled without any problems, they automatically meet the prerequisites in all their other studies. A typical prerequisite is the successful completion of a course whose content is necessary for mastering the course to be registered. Other prerequisites include the obligation of simultaneous enrolment in certain courses (for example, the prohibition of enrolment in a course taught in the form of lectures and completed by examination without simultaneous enrolment in a corresponding course taught in the form of seminars and completed by fulfilling the requirements); prohibition of enrolment in a course if a course of the same content has already been completed or recognized, prohibition of simultaneous enrolment in courses of the same content; prohibition of enrolment in a course if a prescribed number of credits has not been achieved, etc. Where a prerequisite “approval” is present, an explicit approval by the teacher is required (through granting an exemption).\nA prerequisite concerning university-wide PE courses is a prohibition to enrol in PE courses by students in bachelor’s and master's programmes who have already successfully completed two semester-long PE courses (students of the mentioned programmes are entitled to take two semesters of PE, students of follow-up master’s programmes are not entitled to enrol in PE courses); two PE courses cannot be taken concurrently.\n(8)\tPrior to the beginning of the registration period, the dean is entitled to determine a minimum number of students enrolled in a course; in case such number is not enrolled in the course, the dean is entitled to cancel the teaching in the course unless the course is compulsory (Section 8(3)(a)). In such case, an enrolled student has the right to additionally enrol in courses with a similar credit value.\nExplanationAt any time during the period of course registration, course enrolment and the period for changes in course enrolment, the student is allowed to make changes to their application for course enrolment in a given semester. Courses may be added or cancelled in the electronic application.\nIn the period for course enrolment and changes in course enrolment during which enrolment is being confirmed, the student is allowed to make changes to the enrolment that has already been confirmed. Any changes end as per midnight of the last day of the period for course enrolment. The student is obliged to duly study the courses in which they enrolled.\nCourses with a different mode of enrolment must be specified in the IS MU. This applies to intensive and specially scheduled courses.\nSuccessful enrolment in courses of the following semester (confirmed enrolment) means that the student will be able to study and complete these courses provided the student has the right to enrol in the next semester (Section 12).",

The decision to interrupt the studies for serious or ordinary reasons has a major impact on the calculation of the duration of studies; it is therefore advisable to seek the expert opinion of the Teiresias Centre in the case of requests for interruptions for serious reasons, mainly within the subgroup of medical conditions.\n(3)\tIn the decision on interruption of studies, the dean shall set the beginning and end dates of the interruption period; the dean is entitled to determine further conditions for enrolment in the semester immediately following re-enrolment in studies. If a person in the recognized parental period files a request for re-enrolment in studies at a date prior to the end of the interruption period, such request shall be granted by the dean.\n(4)\tStudies may be interrupted by the dean until a resit date of the state examination, doctoral state examination or doctoral thesis defence.\nExplanationThis is an “ex officio” interruption, independent of the student’s will. It is used in the period between the dates of the repeated final state examinations.\n(5)\tStudies are interrupted for a period of whole semesters extended by the remainder of the semester when the request was filed. If the period of interruption cannot be set so as not to exceed the standard duration of study and at the same time the total duration of study including interruptions does not exceed twice the standard duration of study, the studies shall be terminated in accordance with Section 15(1)(b); the total duration of study does not include interruption periods specified in subsections 1(b), 3 and 4.\nExplanationCorrection: the total duration of study does not include interruption periods specified in subsections 1(b), 2 and 4.\nRe-enrolment in studies must be made in the period for enrolment in the next semester so that the student has the possibility to duly enrol in courses.\nThe total duration of study is calculated as the sum of the number of days during which the person is a student of that study and the number of days during which that study was interrupted for reasons other than a recognized parenting period or serious reasons. The total duration of study must not exceed double the standard duration of the relevant study.\n(6)\tFor the purpose of assessing a request for interruption under this section, the starting date of the semester means the end of the period for changing enrolment in courses (Section 11(7)), defined by the academic year schedule.\n(7)\tThe end of the study interruption period in General Medicine or Dentistry of a student who submitted an application to the advanced master’s state examination or its last part may be set by the dean to the beginning of the period for final state examinations of the last semester of the interruption period.\n(8)\tThe end of the study interruption period of a student who submitted an application to the doctoral state examination or doctoral thesis defence may be set by the dean no later than one working day before such examination or defence; in such case, the faculty shall inform the student about the date of the examination or defence no later than thirty days in advance.\n(9)\tA person ceases to be a student of MU on the day of interruption of studies or of the last concurrent study.\nExplanationIn the period of interruption of the only study or in the period of interruption of all the concurrent studies, the student loses all student rights and status, except for the right to re-enrol in the studies, to enrol in a semester after re-enrolment, and except for work on the diploma thesis, which must be stated in the decision on interruption. The student is also allowed to register courses during the period for registration in the semester in which the student intends to resume the studies after re-enrolment.",

        "title": "Section 14 – Recognition of Completed Parts of Studies",
        "answer": "(1)\tThe dean is entitled to recognize a course completed:\nin previous or concurrent studies at MU,\n\tin previous or concurrent studies at another higher education institution in the Czech Republic or abroad,\n\tin previous or concurrent studies in an accredited educational programme at a tertiary vocational school in the Czech Republic or abroad,\n\tin previous or concurrent studies in lifelong learning up to 60% of the minimum credit value of studies for which the courses are recognized.\nPrevious studies for the purposes of this section mean studies completed under Section 55 or 56 of the Act.\nExplanationThe dean may choose not to recognize a course. One of the preconditions for recognition is the concordance of contents of the courses.\nNamísto předmětu X lze žádat o uznání předmětu obsahově shodného, Y. Obsahová shoda předmětů je buď definována studijním programem, nebo o ní rozhodne garant studijního programu.\nInstead of course X, the student may apply for recognition of course Y whose content is equal. The concordance of content is defined by the degree programme or is decided by the degree programme guarantor.\nRecognition of the final state examination, advanced master’s state examination in Medicine, doctoral state examination, individual parts of these examinations, doctoral thesis defence from previous studies or from a concurrent study at another HE institution is inadmissible.\n(2)\tA course that is compulsory or selective may be recognized under subsection 1 in the relevant studies. The dean may specify other courses that can be recognized, except for courses mentioned in Section 8(4).\n(3)\t\tThe dean may also recognize a set of courses instead of a course or a group of courses prescribed for the studies.\n(4)\tA request for the recognition of parts of studies completed outside of MU submitted by a student must include:\na full transcript of records, i.e. an official certificate of completion of each course including grades, credits and number of failed course completion attempts, and\n\tan official transcript of the course syllabus including a description of the course’s place in the relevant programme.\nExplanationThe student does not need to submit documents concerning recognized courses that are available to the Office for Studies in the IS MU.\n(5)\tThe dean is entitled to require that the course be recognized by passing an equivalency examination or meet other equivalency requirements; in such case, the dean shall determine an examiner or a method of equivalency requirements fulfilment. For recognition purposes, the original assessment of the course is substituted with an assessment of the equivalency examination or a result of equivalency requirements fulfilment.\nExplanationIf, for example, the equivalency examination is assessed with a C grade, whereas the original grading of the course to be recognized was A, the new, C grade is entered in the records.\n(6)\tThe assessment and a record of the number of failed course completion attempts are recognized along with the course completion. If the recognized course was not assessed with credits, its credit value is determined in line with the rules applicable to the relevant studies.\nExplanationIf a course is recognized without an equivalency examination or requirements, its original grading is entered in the records.\n(7)\tThe completion of courses or a set of courses from previous duly completed studies may be recognized with credits in the aggregate amount by which the number of credits gained in previous studies exceeds thirty times the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the number of semesters.\nExplanationThe provision of Section 14(7) does not constitute an entitlement to recognition with credits. The recognition is decided on by the dean (or an authorized vice-dean) based on the student’s request.\nThe provision of Section 14(7) concerns in particular those students who study in a follow-up master’s programme and in the previous duly completed bachelor’s programme gained more credits than the minimum value. These “surplus” credits may be transferred to the follow-up programme upon a request for recognition. However, both of the following requirements must be fulfilled when the provision is applied.\nThe requirement of Section 14(1) under which only those courses may be recognized (with or without credits) that are compulsory or selective in relation to the studies for which they are recognized, and, as the case may be, other courses determined by the dean. The provision of Section 6(4) defines the minimum credit value of the studies. Only the number of credits gained by the student in the previous studies exceeding the minimum credit value of these previous studies may be transferred to the subsequent (e.g. follow-up master’s) studies.\nExample 1: The minimum credit value of studies in the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student completed the studies within the standard duration and as part of the studies completed courses X (6 credits), Y (8 credits) and Z (4 credits), which are prescribed as compulsory in the follow-up master’s programme. Thus the student gained 190 credits in the bachelor’s studies. The student can have all the three courses recognized to the follow-up master’s programme. However, only 10 credits will be transferred to the minimum credit value of the master’s programme (not 18, which was the real value of the courses).\nExample 2: The minimum credit value of studies in the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the studies after 7 semesters (he studied one semester longer than the standard duration) and gained 200 credits. This number does not exceed the value of 7 x 30 = 210, prescribed by Section 14(7). No credits can be transferred to the follow-up master’s studies. However, if the student completed some courses which are compulsory or selective for the follow-up master’s studies in which he is enrolled, such courses may be recognized without credits.\nExample 3: The minimum credit value of studies in the bachelor’s programme is 180 credits. The student finished the studies after 5 semesters (one semester less than the standard duration) and gained 200 credits. With reference to Section 14(7), the student requests the transfer of courses worth (200–5 x 30) = 50 credits to the follow-up master’s studies. However, courses worth 50 credits cannot be recognized even if they were compulsory or selective courses, because after the deduction, the credit value attributable previous bachelor’s studies would decrease to 200–50 = 150 credits, which is below the minimum credit value of the studies. Therefore, only 20 credits may be recognized; potential further courses may be recognized without credits.\nThe provision of Section 14(7) also applies to students who duly completed any studies and wish to have certain courses recognized to subsequent studies. If, for example, the student has a bachelor’s diploma in Mathematics and his further studies will be the bachelor’s programme in Physics, all the courses in maths can be recognized in the subsequent studies from the point of content. However, in case he gained the minimum credit value (180 credits) in his bachelor’s studies of maths, the courses will be recognized with zero credit value. In fact it means that the student cannot get another diploma for courses recognized on the grounds of content similarity. He must achieve the minimum credit value of the studies again.\nThis situation differs from concurrent studies, where credits may be gained concurrently.\nIf subjects with a credit value were recognized or recorded for the student in the course of study that was terminated in accordance with § 55 of the Act from a previous study, then the amount of these credits must be deducted from the total amount of credits in the course of study that was terminated in accordance with § 55 of the Act exceed thirty times the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the number of semesters, and that is if it would be possible to recognize credits, which in aggregate amount exceed thirty times the duration of duly completed studies expressed in the number of semesters, for the purposes of further study.\n(8)\tThe aggregate amount of credits recognized in accordance with subsection 1 is excluded from the number of credits used for assessing the fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in the next semester under Section 12(2)(a), (b) and (d); however, it is included in the number of credits used for assessing whether minimum credit value was reached as well as for assessing the fulfilment of requirements for enrolment in the next semester according to Section 12(2)(c).\nExplanationThe credit value of recognized courses is not relevant for the assessment of the right to enrol in the next semester under Section 12(2)(a), (b) and (d).\nOn the other hand, the credit value of courses recognized from previous studies is included into the minimum credit value of the studies for which these courses were recognized with credits, which also includes the assessment whether the student has the right to enrol in the next semester under Section 12(2)(c).\n(9)\tNo part of the final state examination, doctoral state examination or, in the fields of General Medicine and Dentistry, the advanced master’s state examination can be recognized from previous or concurrent studies.\n(10)\tFor the purposes of assessing the fulfilment of the requirements for study, all compulsory and selective courses (Section 8(3)) completed at MU during the course of previous unsuccessful studies, including their credit value, are automatically included, as long as the duration of the period between their completion and enrolment in a given studies does not exceed three years.\n(11)\tThe transfer of courses completed as part of foreign mobility programmes is governed by an MU directive.\nExplanationStudents are obliged to register their stay abroad in an IS MU application. The requisites of registration of a stay abroad before its beginning and after its end are set out in the Guidelines issued by the Centre for International Cooperation.\nIf the outcomes of a stay abroad are transferred by MU into the studies, the student is obliged to promptly register in the IS MU the documents prescribed by the CIC Guidelines. The outcomes from a stay abroad are transferred into the semester in which the student \nstayed abroad.\n((12)\tAfter returning from study abroad, at the request of the student and according to the possibilities of the degree programme, the requirements for fulfilling the study obligations shall be adjusted in order to limit the necessity of prolonging the studies.",

The diploma is in the language of the relevant programme. The bilingual diploma supplement is issued in Czech and English. At the request of a graduate, the faculty shall provide a translation of their diploma into English or Czech, including the faculty stamp and authorized person’s signature.\nExplanationAt the request of the student, the Office for Studies will print out the translation of the diploma into English or Czech with a clause saying that the diploma no. xxx translation is only valid together with the diploma original.

        "title": "Section 16 – Completion of Courses",
        "answer": "(1)\tCourse completion means meeting the requirements of the course by a due deadline or on a resit date as follows:\nby grading where an examination is assessed on a scale from “excellent” to “satisfactory” or\n\tin a manner not using grades where a course subject to credits is assessed as “credited” and a colloquium is assessed as “passed”.\nConditions of course completion may also include the fulfilment of requirements of in-term assessment; its result may be included in assessment under subsections 1 or 2.\n(2) If it is not possible to ensure the simultaneous presence of at least two examined students in an oral examination held in the presence of a single examiner, the examiner shall arrange for the presence of a third person from among MU employees or, with the consent of the examined student, shall arrange for another suitable way of verifying the course of the oral examination.\nExplanationSubsequent verification of the course of an oral examination in another suitable way is possible by making an audio recording of the examination on a medium of the examiner or by making a written record of the examination by the examiner. Another method of subsequent verification of an oral examination may be decided by the dean. The course of an oral examination is regulated by  Guidelines of the RMU Office for Studies No. 1/2024.\n(3)\tDeadlines for course completion are announced via the IS MU no later than two weeks prior to the beginning of the examination period. Deadlines and resits are scheduled so as to enable compliance with the provisions of Section 18(3) and Section 19(5) and their number corresponds to the manner of course completion, number of students enrolled and course specification.\n(4)\tDeadlines for course completion take place during the examination period or during the last two weeks of teaching in a semester; this does not apply to enrolment in intensive or specially scheduled courses, whose deadlines may be set for the period of teaching in a semester.\nExplanationThis is a general provision, without specification of the number of deadlines announced. However, if at least one student is enrolled in a course for the first time, at least one regular deadline and two resits must be scheduled to comply with the provisions of Section 18(3) and Section 19(5). If the student believes the number of deadlines and resit dates is not sufficient, they have the right to address the guarantor of the field of study. The dates under subsection 6(a) may be used by the students until the last day of the period for enrolment in the next semester (they are entitled to work on the fulfilment of the requirements for enrolment in the next semester until then). In the period between the end of enrolment in the next semester and the thirteenth calendar day following the beginning of teaching, only the students enrolled in the current semester are entitled to take exams.\n(5)\tA credit course completion date may be set during the period of teaching in a semester at the request of a student who has fulfilled all the other requirements necessary for the completion.\nExplanationIn courses completed by fulfilling the requirements, the student’s workload concentrates to the period when the classes are held. The student may fulfil the course requirements even before the end of the teaching and ask the examiner for a date of completion before the exam period. The examiner may, but is not obliged to, grant the request.\n(6)\tResits take place during the examination period or:\nduring the teaching period of the subsequent semester, but not later than on the thirteenth calendar day following the beginning of teaching; these dates are only available to students who have enrolled in that semester, or\n\tduring the examination period of the subsequent semester in case this period precedes the beginning of the teaching period of that course; these dates are only available to students who have enrolled in that semester.\n(7)\tThe dean is entitled to determine a period for completion of a course in the combined and distance study mode in a bachelor’s and master’s programme and in all study modes of a doctoral programme also outside the examination period.\nExplanationIn the combined mode of all types of degree programmes and in all forms of doctoral degree programmes, it is possible, on the basis of a decision of the dean (usually by a measure of the dean), to announce the dates of course completion without reference to the provisions of subsection 4.\n(8)\tUnless provided otherwise in the course specification, a student registers for the course completion date via the IS MU.\n(9)\tIn case a student fails to excuse their absence from the course completion on the registered date within five working days via the IS MU, or if they fail to take part in the course completion, they receive a “failed” grade, marked as “-” (Section 17(1)).\n(10)\tThe provisions hereof concerning resits shall not apply to in-term assessment whose results are included in the final grade. A student whose absence from in-term assessment is duly excused shall be given an alternative opportunity by the teacher to meet the requirements of the in-term assessment.\nExplanationThe student who has used the permitted absences under Section 9(6) is not entitled to a resit for the fulfilment of in-term assessment available to duly excused students.\n(11)\tThe teacher shall communicate the result of the in-term assessment to the student within ten working days of the assessment.\n(12)\tA student who has not met the requirements of the in-term assessment during the semester is graded with an “X” and is not eligible to register for the course completion.\n(13)\tA student is entitled to consult the assessment of a written work or test that forms part of the course completion within fifteen days of being informed of the assessment under subsection 11 or Section 7(3).

The advanced master’s state examination in General Medicine and Dentistry does not include diploma thesis defence.\nExplanationA mandatory part of the final state examination in bachelor’s studies is the defence of the bachelor's thesis if the thesis is required in the given programme; in master’s studies, it is the defence of the master’s thesis. Another part of the final state examination and advanced master's state examination are the so-called subjects.\nDiploma theses are assessed as “passed with excellent results”, “passed” or “failed”.\nRecognition of the final state examination, advanced master’s state examination, doctoral state examination, individual parts of these examinations, doctoral thesis defence from previous studies or from a concurrent study at another HE institution is inadmissible.\nIn case the student has concurrent studies, which are completed with the final state examinations whose parts are not common or substitutable, each of the studies is completed separately in accordance with these Regulations. For concurrent studies completed with the final state examination whose certain parts are common or substitutable and at the same time their concordance or substitutability is stated in the accreditation, a separate procedure or the following procedure can be taken: If the student has met all the conditions for registering for the final state examination in two or more concurrent studies and if the student registers for the examination in all the studies simultaneously, they will take the common or substitutable parts of all these exams only once.

        "answer": "In applications for teachers (Teacher‘s Notebook), you need to specify which mode you want to work in. The system gives you a choice between the courses you teach in a given semester and those that are set up in the Catalog so that grades can be entered by all teachers (group projects, supervision of theses, etc.). If you have the s_vyuka access right, you are offered a choice of other departmental courses. On the course selection page, always check the faculty and the semester selected at the top.\n \n\nSimultaneous selection of multiple courses\nThe teacher can select multiple courses at the same time in applications that allow this by checking them at the selection page. The application will then work with a list of all students enrolled in all of the courses selected. You can also add a course to the selection by clicking \"Change filter\" and then \"Select course\".\n          Change of course\nTo change a course or list of courses, always click on \"other courses\" at the top of the page next to the course name.\n         On each page of the Teacher's Notebook, you have a header with an overview of the selected courses.

        "answer": "The filters listed below can be applied to the student list. We may want to filter the list of students enrolled in selected courses, e.g. to students enrolled for one or more specific examination dates, restrict the list to a selected seminar group, restrict the list to students repeating the course, etc. \n  \n\nIf you check multiple filters at the same time, you can select the operator (AND, OR) that will be used to concatenate the filters. Thus, you can include in the selection persons who meet all the conditions simultaneously (AND) or meet at least one of the conditions (OR). By default setting, all conditions are to be met simultaneously (AND). \n\nAny number of filters can be applied at the same time. For example, if we check simultaneously \"restrict to students repeating the course as a result of failing to complete it\" and \"restrict to students who have failed to complete the course\" filters, we get a list of students likely to fail their study. \n\n\nTo apply a filter, check the required course(s) at the top, then check the required filter(s) at the bottom, and then click the Selected button below the checked course. It is assumed that you select course without filters more often than you select course applying filters.\n\nTo change the current filter, click on the \"change filter\". \n\nFor your information, the current list of enabled filters is displayed at the top of each page. Please pay due attention to it.  \n\n\n1 Display the current filters.\n2 Link to change the filter.\n\nWork with the current listIf you make changes in the current selection of students when working with the Teacher’s Notebook (e.g. if you have limited the selection to a certain seminar group and then you enroll a student from another seminar group to that group), the selection is not automatically updated. To update the selection, click \"Update\" in the Teacher‘s Notebook header.\n\nTip: Quickly select a seminar groupIf you want to work with a specific seminar group, you do not need to select a filter. When you enter the Teacher's Notebook, your courses will automatically list the seminar groups where you are the teacher. You can work with the selected seminar group immediately.\nIndividual filters:\nextend the list to those who have registered (i.e. who have not yet had their registration confirmed)\nThe Teacher's Notebook applications work with the list of enrolled students, i.e. those whose registration has been confirmed by the faculty's study department. If this has not yet been done, the teacher can check \"incl. the students who have registered for the course (not enrolled yet)\" to extend the processed list of students to include registered students, i.e. students who have expressed interest in registering for the course.\n          expand the list to include completed and inactive\nThis option will include students with completed and inactive studies in the list of students.\n          seminar groups  – students\nof my seminar groups\nThe selection of students is limited only to students enrolled in my seminar groups.\n              of the seminar groups to be selected\nThis filter allows you to select only students from certain seminar groups.

Case is not considered when entering the code. If the code is not entered, the filter will not be applied. If you select \"any term\" then it will filter to those students who have or have had a course entered by code in any of the terms. The student does not have to have taken the course in the same study, students who have taken the course in any of their studies will be included (assessed via individuals, not studies).\n              who completed another course\nA page to specify will be displayed to select the term and course code of the course taken. You can select whether the student must have taken all courses or only some of the courses listed.\n\n who have not enrolled in the course, but only registered for it (use in combination with the extend the list to registered students option)\nOnly those students who are not enrolled in the selected course, but only registered for it, will be included in the list. When selecting this filter, you must also extend the list to include registered students. It is also important to note that the check for automatic student enrollment in a course always takes place around midnight. The data obtained by this selection is therefore current as of that date.\ntype of studies – students\nselected by type of studies\nTypes of study are: B bachelor's degree, M master's degree, N master's follow-up degree, D doctoral degree, R advanced master's state examination, C lifelong education.\n                selected by study mode\nThe forms of study are: full-time, distance, combined and lifelong.\n              of the fields/plans of study to be selected\nThe selection of students can be filtered to students of specific fields of study.

Semester evaluation is done at the current point in time and not at the time the course was/will be taught. Only active (not interrupted or completed) studies are selected. A student may study more than one active studies in one semester and may be in a different semester in each of studies. Therefore, one student may be in multiple semesters at the same time.\n              selected by the stage, year or block currently enrolled in\nThe selection of students can be limited to students who are currently studying a particular stage/year/block (depending on the terminology used in the faculty). See also the notes on semester filters. Here the analogy applies. The faculty does not need to record the stage/year/block at all.\n              selected by study group\nSome faculties use a numerical attribute of study – study group. The student is thus assigned to a specific study group for the entire period of study (or at least until the study group number changes). This study group is applied to all courses studied in the degree programme.  \n\nAfter selecting this filter, a page to specify will appear with a list of study groups to which students registered for the selected courses belong. Check the required study group(s).\ntopic lists – students\nenrolled in the topics of course topic list to be selected\nThe selection of students can be limited to only those students who are enrolled in a particular topic from the course topic list. A course topic list is one that is linked to a specific course in which the student will participate. It is not a topic list of theses. You have to first select this filter and confirm with the \"Apply filter\" button. Then choose one or more topics from the course topic list and confirm the choice with the \"Select\" button.\n              not present on any course list\nThe selection of students can be limited to only students who are not enrolled in any topic on any of the course topic lists.\n              enrolled in the topics of faculty topic lists to be selected\nThe selection of students can be limited only to students who are enrolled in a specific topic from the faculty's topic lists.

Then specify whether you want to work with students who met attendance requirements (those who have met requirements in all attendance notebooks), with students who did not meet attendance requirements (those who have not met requirements in at least one attendance notebooks while all of notebooks have been evaluated) or with not yet evaluated attendance (those who have at least one attendance notebook that is not evaluated yet).\n              selected by their score recorded in a notebook\nThe selection of students can be limited by the number of points achieved by students, which are listed in the selected notebook. You have to first select this filter and confirm it with the \"Apply filter\" button. Then type the number of points you want to select a group of students on the basis of. You have to confirm the selection by clicking on the button \"Select\".\n              selected by the text recorded in a notebook\nThe selection of students can also be limited by the word given in the selected notebook. The word can only be made up of letters, numbers, asterisk (*), at sign (@) and underscore (_). This filter can also be used to select students who, on the other hand, do not have the word in the notebook. You have to first select this filter and confirm with the \"Apply filter\" button. Then enter the word or characters you want to select the group of students based on in the free field. You have to confirm your choice by clicking the \"Select\" button.\n              with filled Homework Vault\nTo select students with a filled homework vault, you have to first select this filter and confirm with the \"Apply filter\" button.

        "answer": "The Term Calendar delineates registration period, course enrollment period, and period of enrollment changes. During these periods, students are allowed to select (register for)\nthe courses they want to enroll in as well as cancel their registration.\nThe student selects the courses he/she wants to register for either by looking them up using their codes or by\npicking them out from a registration template. He/she can register for any course offered at the University in the given term.\nThe start and end dates of registration period, which are specified in the Term Calendar, differ from faculty to faculty.\nIf the student meets the conditions described in the Course Catalogue, the registration of a specific course is problem-free (white), otherwise it is problematic (red).\nDuring the period of enrollment and enrollment changes, problem-free courses are confirmed each night and during each enrollment change (the difference between the period of enrollment and enrollment changes is only didactic – changes usually take place in the first two weeks of the semester). By enrolling, the student acquires the right and obligation to study the course.\n\nThe system only enrolls (confirms) courses for active studies. A student can register even if he/she has interrupted studies.

The application prompts the student to send an email explaining why they should be admitted to the course even if they do not meet the requirements. The email is sent to the teacher, the course guarantor or the contact person, depending on who is set to be responsible for handling exceptions in the basic course-related data. The substantiation is also displayed directly in the application for each request.

So, for example, if a prerequisite is entered as IB000 && \"whatever\" and the student has not completed IB000, then \"whatever\" is no longer even evaluated and IB000 is listed as an error.

        "title": "How to Post Study Materials on IS MU",
        "answer": "Creating folders in Study Materials\nIf the user wants to publish more materials, it is advisable to first create folders or even subfolders. You can create a folder by clicking the \n          \n          icon in the top tool menu above the contents of the currently open folder and clicking the Folder\n           icon.\n          If the user has \"More Options\" turned on in File Manager, he/she will see the Add expanded menu and can create a new folder simply by clicking the Create New Folder\n           icon.\n         When creating a folder, it is necessary to fill in the folder name, e.g. \"Slides from lectures\".\nTwo more optional sections can be found under the \"More options\" link. The first is the Abbreviation. This is used to internally identify the file or folder when creating an Internet address that references the file or folder. If the abbreviation is not filled in, the IS will automatically generate the abbreviation. The second optional field is Description. In this field you can write additional information about the folder, e.g. for which study materials the folder is intended. In addition, you can create multiple folders at once by simply clicking the Another Folder button using the Create New Folder option. After filling in one or more names and clicking the OK button, the folder (or folders) will be created in the currently open Study Materials folder.\n¨\nUploading study materials from a computer\nThe file (or multiple files) can be uploaded to the study materials folder in two basic ways.\nYou can upload a new file by clicking the\n          \n icon in the top tool menu above the contents of the currently opened folder and clicking the Upload Files \n           icon.\n          If the user has \"More options\" turned on in File Manager, he/she will see the Add menu expanded and can add files simply by clicking on the Upload Files\n           icon.\n\nWhen clicked, a dialog box opens with a Select files button. After clicking this button, the user needs to select one or more files from the user's computer. If the user wishes to upload the files to the study materials under a different name than they are stored on his/her computer, he/she must click on the Rename \n\n           icon.\n\tThe optional fields Name, Name of file and Description can be filled in here. If the Name field is not filled in, the file will be saved under the same name under which it is uploaded from the computer.\nThe second way to upload files from your computer to your study materials is by using the Drag&Drop feature. In this case, simply \"drag and drop\" the selected files from your computer into the currently open folder box in the user's browser window. This procedure will then bring up the Upload files application window itself, where the currently dragged files will already be selected. It is then possible to proceed as with the first method of uploading files.\nUploading a large number of files or a folder tree with materials\nIf the user wants to publish a lot of materials or a whole tree of materials (e.g. from his/her website), it is necessary to package these materials into one ZIP file. You can import files from a zipped file by clicking the\n\n          \nicon in the top tool menu above the contents of the currently opened folder and clicking the Extract ZIP\n           icon.\nIf the user has \"More Options\" turned on in File Manager, he/she will see the Add menu expanded and can upload zipped files simply by clicking on the Extract ZIP \n\n           icon.\n\nFrom here, simply click on the Select File button and select the ZIP file from your computer. A variety of options can also be set for how to unzip and upload a given ZIP file to your study materials.\nCopying study materials from another course\nStudy materials can also be filled by copying study materials from another course. For this function, you need to go to the folder from which you want to copy the study materials, select the file or folder (or multiple files and folders) by checking the check-box in front of the file name and then click the \n          button in the right toolbar. A new window will then open in which you need to enter the address in the IS to which the files are to be copied. This can be done either by typing in the exact address or by searching for the appropriate folder using the Find button. The actual copying is done by clicking on the OK button. In case the user wants to copy all study materials in a given course, it is preferable to use the appropriate copying application in the Teacher agenda. In the case of courses where it is desirable to share the material tree completely, it is preferable (rather than copying) to use the sharing application (the other course will not have its own material tree, both courses will have one common one).

        "answer": "The e-learning guide is used to easily copy study materials, interactive syllabus and ROPOTs from one semester to the next. It is automatically displayed to the teacher when he/she enters a blank course to prepare it for teaching. The e-learning guide allows the teacher to copy prepared materials from the previous term. Or the teacher can refuse to copy the materials (for example, if he/she takes over a course from another colleague and wants to create completely new e-learning materials).\nVideo tutorial on copying learning materials from one course to another:\n\n\nWhen copying materials using the e-learning guide, the teacher decides whether to:\ncopy only the structure of the folders without the files – this very specific option is used by teachers of courses without interactive syllabus who have created a complex folder structure which they only refill during the semester, for example with teaching presentations. Files embedded directly into the interactive syllabus are not affected. We recommend that most teachers leave the option unchecked.\n        copy including the structure of the homework vaults –  the set of homework vaults are also copied and the submission dates will be adjusted according to the new semester schedule.\n        copy including the course-related instructions – all files in the Course-Related Instructions folder are copied.\n        copy including peer assessment – all peer assessments set up will be copied. The submission and assessment dates will be automatically adjusted to the new semester schedule.\nTip: The e-learning guide didn't turn up!If a teacher finishes the e-learning guide and wants to return to it later, they can always find it available on the front page of the selected course in the Teacher app:\nThe Information System  Teacher  [selected course]  E-learning guide\n\n1 The e-learning guide is available at any time on the front page of the selected course.\n\nWhat if the course already has a folder filled with study materials?If the e-learning guide indicates that the selected course already has a folder filled with learning materials, it means that something is already uploaded in the course. This situation occurs when, for example, there is no consensus among the instructors of a course and one of them has already uploaded a presentation to the learning materials. The same situation occurs if, for example, a teacher has already sent an email to the enrolled students of a course, which is automatically saved in the Mail folder.\nIn all of these cases, the system protects the newly uploaded files from being accidentally deleted and notifies the course that the course has already populated the study materials folder. It is necessary to look at which files are preventing copying and consider (in consultation with other subject teachers) deleting them. Only in an empty course can study materials and e-learning be copied via the e-learning guide.\nFor advanced settings for copying course materials, the application can also be used:\nThe Information System  Teacher  [selected course in the new term]  (Study Materials)  Sharing and copying study materials  Copy Study Materials",

The Excel workbook will not be accepted by the application. \n\n      \n      You can have a notebook of just one name in one file, even if it belongs to multiple courses at the same time. However, when importing a file, you must first select all (or more) courses that appear in the file.

This data must not be changed in the process of processing the assessment outside the IS. The first number of the identification string is the student's učo and the second is the course code. The identification string contains some extra data in order to recognize an inadvertent change of the identification string as an error. In the form above, you must set the sequence number of the identifier column. If you do not fill it in, it will be an error. The pre-filled column number value corresponds to the column number where the identifier is inserted by the export application. \n\n      \n     The second mandatory column is the content  column. You can specify more than one content column number if you are processing the exported notebook in Excel and you have your own data in multiple columns.

        "answer": "This hour is automatically entered for examination dates for which the enrollment is set to begin in the future. The enrollment time cannot be changed, as time competition between students could lead to an excessive load on the system, which could, for example, limit the operability of the study departments during normal working hours. Setting the default time to 00.00 would unnecessarily shift the need to respond to the night time hour. Other time competitions, such as course registration or registration for seminar groups, start at 17.00, so students are used to this time.\n\n        ",

The same can be done even if it is different courses taught by the same teacher at different faculties.

To create a shared examination date, follow the steps below: \n     The Information system  Teacher  [course selection]  (Examination)  Edit examination dates\n    Choose the courses for which you want to share an examination date, e.g. course X and course Y.

        "title": "Sharing the capacity limit of multiple examination dates",
        "answer": "You can use the Capacity limit sharing by multiple teachers application for multiple examination dates to count enrolled students even if they are enrolled in different courses taught by different teachers. The first teacher creates the examination date, then uses this application to open the possibility for a colleague to add his examination date’s capacity to the examination date of the first teacher. The second teacher will then link the capacity limit. This feature is complicated and not necessary in most cases where a capacity limit needs to be shared. In most cases, the shared examination date is created by the teacher who has access to the Teacher’s Notebook of all courses that have a shared examination date. Therefore, a simpler Examination date sharing  option can be used. .\n      \nProcedure for creating examination dates with a shared limit\n\n      For example, let's have course  A of teacher X and course B of teacher Y in the same faculty (but it can be different faculties and it can also be just one course of one teacher). Teacher Y wants to entrust the organization of the exam to teacher X and teacher X wants to write the exam together for courses A and\n      B in one room K123 with a capacity of 40 seats on 1.1.20ZZ at 8:00 am. \n\n      \n      Teacher X creates an examination date in course A\nMon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123  (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0, max. 40\nopen for reservations to Tue 20 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 20 Dec 20ZY ?\n      then teacher X flags the examination date as shareable. I.e., using the Activate and deactivate capacity-limit sharing in the dates to be selected.. The examination date will then be listed in the form: \n\n      Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0, max. 40\nopen for reservations to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY, capacity-limit sharing enabled\n     In addition, teacher Y in course B  will create an examination date for students in course B. The maximum number of students for this examination date does not need to be set. \n\n      Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0open for reservations to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY\n      Teacher Y then uses the application Link the capacity limit of an examination date of this course to a capacity limit of some other date. Teacher Y selects his term as the secondary examination date  (on the first page of the application) and Teacher Y selects the term of teacher X's course Aas the primary examination date  (on the second page of the application). On the second side of the application, all examination dates that are marked with the \"capacity-limit sharing enabled\" flag are offered, regardless of the course. \n      \n      Once Teacher Y has made this connection, it will be reflected in the listing of both examination dates as follows. Examination date of course A of teacher X:\n      Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0, max. 40\nopen for reservations to Tue 20 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 20 Dec 20ZY, capacity-limit sharing enabled\nThe examination date shares a capacity limit with the following: FF:B Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (autumn 20ZY) info\n      Examination date of course  B of teacher Y: \n      Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (examinations only (no resits)), reservations: 0, max. 40open for reservations to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY?, cancellation possible to Tue 21 Dec 20ZY\nThe examination date shares a capacity limit with the following: FF:A Mon 1.1. 20ZZ 08:00 K123 (autumn 20ZY) [main] info\n\n     We now recommend that teacher X of course Ashould remove the \"capacity-limit sharing enabled\" flag as soon as possible. This will ensure that no more teachers will connect to his examination date. The teacher can remove the flag either in bulk for all his terms by applying the Deactivate capacity-limit sharing in all the examination dates of this course or by Activate and deactivate capacity-limit sharing in the dates to be selected Deselecting the \"capacity-limit sharing enabled\" flag does not deselect an existing connection! \n      \n     If you want to cancel an existing link (limit sharing), use the Deactivate a capacity-limit sharing link application. You can only cancel the information for your examination dates. You can cancel your link to another examination date and you can cancel all links to your course examination dates. \n      \nPrimary and secondary shared examination date\n\n      The limit of maximum number of entries can be shared for pairs, triples, quadruples, ..., in general tuples of dates. The term primary shared examination date includes a single examination date to which secondary examination dates are linked. The primary examination date is the one that the teacher must mark with the \"capacity-limit sharing enabled\" flag. \n\n      \n      Any non-zero number of secondary examination dates can be linked to one primary examination date. A secondary examination date cannot be a primary examination date and, conversely, a primary examination date term cannot be a secondary examination date. \n\n      \n      The resulting limit – the maximum number of students for a tuple of shared examination dates – is the limit specified for the primary examination date. The limits specified for the secondary examination date are ignored (after linking, the limit of the primary examination date is displayed for the secondary examination date). For all shared examination dates, the sum of all registered students is always displayed. (However, other data is not shared anymore.) \n\n      \nRegistering students for an examination on an examination date that has a shared limit\n\n      Students apply for examination dates that share a limit in the same way as for non-shared examination dates. The student does not even need to know (apart from a note in small print) that the term has a shared limit. The examination date information line lists the sum of the number of students registered for all shared examination dates as the number of registered students, and always lists the limit of the primary examination date as the maximum number of students. \n      \n      If one individual (student) registers for both shared examination dates, he/she will be counted twice in the total number of registered students. (One person may only apply for one examination date once.) \n\n      \nI want to work with a list of all students who are registered for an examination date with a shared limit\n\n      Follow these steps to get the list: \n      \nSelection of relevant courses\n\nFiltering the student list\n\n        Both steps can be done at the same time. In the Teacher’s Notebook, enter the course codes from which you want to select students. Enter the codes consecutively, separated by a space. Check ALL of the desired courses. \n\n        \n       Select a filter from the list (in this case \"selected by examination dates\") and click \"Apply filter\". Now IS has listed all the examination dates for all courses. Select the examination dates and courses whose list of students you want to display and confirm your choice using \"Select\". \n\n        \n\n\n        At the top of the screen you can see the courses and examination dates you are working with.\n  Displaying the list of students\n\n         To display the list students, use the \"Show list\" link in the Students section. The list of students who are enrolled for the examination dates for the given courses will be displayed.",

During the examination, the supervisor can check whether the student has filled in the answer sheet with the name on the ISIC according to the ISIC placed on the desk.\nExplain on the board how to write the digits of the učo and the number of the assignment on the answer sheet (see Student Help).\nThe answer sheet cannot be scraped, only gently rubberized.\nEncourage students to prepare their answers first for the assignment. Before the end of the examination, invite them to rewrite them on the answer sheet. If a student makes a mistake on the sheet and there is no corrections section, tear up the sheet and give thim/her a new one to rewrite the information.\n\nEmphasize to the students to mark their answers using a bold line. Some students may try to cheat by marking answers they are unsure of very thinly, which the recognition program may interpret as an unanswered question. The student then waits and, if it was a correct answer, requests a manual correction of the result. We therefore recommend that teachers ignore claims of non-standard marked answers and leave the decision to the recognition program.\nFor handwritten examinations that will be scanned (i.e. answers are written on the answer sheet), warn students that they should not write in the margins of the paper and that only answers on the face of the paper are scanned. The reverse side is not scanned and the student will not see it in IS.\nBefore handing in, ask students to check that they have not forgotten to fill in the assignment number.\nYou may or may not leave the assignment with the students, e.g. you can publish it to them at the end of the examination period by displaying the correct answers in ROPOT description in the IS (this does not apply to handwritten examinations, here you can post the assignment as a separate file, e.g. in the learning materials).\nTell students the date when they will see the grades, scanned answer sheets, or assignments in IS – save yourself questions.\n",

        "title": "What is a seminar group and who can create it?",
        "answer": "Some courses (e.g. those of physical education, English, special medical courses, etc.) require that students be taught in seminar groups. Although each of them can be found in the timetable, they do not bear any unique course identification codes since they are always subsumed under a certain course. Different seminar groups of the same course may be taught by different teachers (seminar tutors). Dividing students into seminar groups with the aid of Information System is optional. Nevertheless, we recommend teachers to do so mainly in the following situations:\n      Seminar groups of the same course are taught by several teachers each of whom wants to be able to perform System operations in his/her students only.\n      Each student only attends one seminar group.\n      Each of the groups can only be attended by a limited number of students.\n\n    Seminar groups are usually created centrally via the application used for importing seminar groups. A Vice-Dean specifies the date on which students can start enrolling in the groups in the Term Calendar. The specification regarding the start time is not required since it is always 17:00 by default.\n      \n\n1 Overview of seminar groups of the subject.\n\n      Seminar groups are identified by a designation – subject code, slash and usually a serial number (there may be another string of letters and numbers). \n      \n      At a glance here. groups, you will find links for further work with groups under the number of individual groups.

Groups have a capacity limit, you can only register for a group where there is space (you cannot register over the limit and e.g. wait for another student to withdraw).\n       There is a control application showing the history of students registering for and deregistering from seminar groups.

        "title": "Sharing the capacity limit with multiple seminar groups",
        "answer": "In exceptional cases, it may be useful to assign multiple seminar groups of students to a single capacity. For example, for some reason a course attended by students from more than one faculty is listed under its own code in each faculty. The agenda allows you to set a fixed maximum number of students; the enrolments of students from all such linked groups are added together. In addition to the limit, other data is evaluated for each group separately, i.e. different enrolment/departure dates, different lecturers, etc. can be set.\n\n        Recommended methodology for capacity sharing:\n        After the instructors have agreed that a certain exercise/seminar is to be run jointly for multiple groups, set the desired limit for one of the groups and check the \"limit can be shared\" flag.\n         The Information system  Teacher  [course selection]   (Seminar Groups)  Work with groups\n        Using\n        The Information system  Teacher  [course selection]   (Seminar Groups)  capacity-limit sharing\n        Mark the other groups whose students are to be included in the capacity. Link them to the appropriate group with the set limit. This completes the capacity sharing. If the exercise/seminar is no longer to be shared between multiple groups, uncheck the capacity sharing (in the capacity sharing application) and subsequently the \"limit can be shared\" flag (in Group handling). The sharing application always lists all courses whose limit can be shared; unchecking the flag prevents someone from accidentally linking to your group and makes the listing clearer for other teachers.\n\n\n        Note that in a credit-based learning system, effectively once a course has been taken, it should always be listed under a single course code, so this solution is an unadvisable compromise.\n        It is possible to share multiple groups within a single course, multiple groups within multiple courses in a given faculty, or across faculties. Follow-on groups must always all be assigned to the same university time period (semester).\n        ",

Implicitně mají všechny publikace nastaven přístup pro všechny autory. S publikačním záznamem smí dále \n      manipulovat ten, kdo provedl poslední změnu záznamu (publikaci zavedl nebo ji naposledy opravil).\n      \n      Aby ostatní autoři nemohli záznam modifikovat, lze zrušit povolení editace pro ostatní autory v editačním formuláři publikace.

Cílem je, aby životopisy členů akademické obce univerzity byly aspoň částečně shodně strukturované.\n\t\nSystém vám nabízí možnost vytvořit si několik životopisů a to i v různých jazycích. Předpokládá se, že budete mít alespoň jednu cizojazyčnou variantu životopisu (např. anglickou nebo německou), primárně dostupnou pro zájemce o informace ze zahraničí. Českou verzi budete používat např. jako přílohu ke grantovým přihláškám, k podkladům pro habilitační či profesorské řízení apod. Více variant životopisů i v témže jazyce vám systém umožňuje zadávat proto, abyste si mohli vytvořit speciální verzi životopisu pro konkrétní (možná i jedinečný) účel. Aby se vám tato verze snadno vytvářela, můžete si tvořený životopis předvyplnit jinou hotovou variantou (vaší nebo i jiné osoby).\n\t\nSystém umožňuje rozlišit, které vaše životopisy uvidíte/můžete použít pouze vy, a které budou zveřejněny.

        "title": "What is e-learning?",
        "answer": "E-learning is a learning process using information technology, including the network environment. There are two main objectives. The first objective is to develop distance learning. Statistically, it is known that a significant proportion of students fail to complete the course when studying on their own without a teacher. E-learning techniques try to partially replace the role of the teacher by: \n\nadvanced study materials, where the student chooses the level of depth (difficulty) of the discussed topic and where the explanation is supplemented by multimedia - pictures, recordings, video recordings,\ntest applications, where the student can test how well he/she understands the material and can apply it,\ncommunication applications that put the self-student in contact with classmates and the tutor (discussion forum, real-time discussion on a computer network),\nadministrative tools that help the teacher to effectively assess students, generate statistics on which the course can be further improved, etc.\nWell-designed, didactically sound, fully e-learning courses can make higher education accessible to people who cannot attend full-time classes. In the IS MU environment, both free and commercial e-learning courses can be designed for the general public. \n\n\nThe second objective is to promote mainstream forms of teaching. The MU Information System offers the tools described above to all teachers to support their pedagogical goals. The tools can be used completely independently or in cooperation with faculty support - e.g. you need help with converting study material into a suitable format, with creating a set of test questions, with setting up the Course Catalogue so that your assigned tutors (e.g. selected students) can moderate the discussion forum, answer questions, correct homework. If you are interested in being e-learning active, please inquire with the faculty e-technician or contact him at \n etechfimunicz.\n\n     ",

        "answer": "The system searches for similarities across the shared database of compared documents, which includes, in addition to the IS MU document server, final theses of participating schools in the\n          Theses.cz system, seminar and other theses in the \n       Odevzdej.cz, system, scientific publications in the\n       Repozitar.cz system and other documents in information systems operated by MU.\n\n\nBecause a significant amount of work and documents are not public, searching the common database is an effective tool for finding possible plagiarism. A student cannot just submit a seminar paper to a friend from another school, because there is a high probability that he is already in the system and there would be similarities. The assignment of seminar and final thesis topics is often repeated, and it is therefore likely that the system will already know about the source documents from which this topic is usually drawn.\n\nThe search for similarities also includes an algorithm that analyzes the document being compared and examines it from sources on the Internet. This procedure has various technical limitations and is computationally and time consuming. Therefore, it is preferably used for archives of final theses. Due to the speed of processing, seminar papers in submission offices and long answers in ROPOTs are primarily compared against a shared database of all source documents. This includes, among other things, resources from the Internet, which have been traced in the past for the purpose of checking some of the millions of final theses being compared.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between finding similarities to seminar papers (for which the shared resource database is used) and final papers (for which the shared resource database is enriched with newly downloaded resources from the Internet). But there is no need to worry, the database is really large, so in most cases the system \"knows\" enough resources that students usually draw from, as well as enough resources that students usually describe.\n        \nTip: Files in File Depository and My Web won't be displayed to othersFiles in File Depository and My Web  will be included in the\nsimilarity searches only if they are in the user's File Depository or user's My\nWeb.

For example, at any time later with another improved version of the algorithm. Remember that copying time can sometimes mean a lot of extra work to repair your reputation.

For individual records, sessions or operations, only those options that are relevant at the time, i.e. can be performed, are offered.\nNoteThe application works with the selection of students that the teacher has chosen when entering the Teacher agenda\n (active students of the course or perhaps just one seminar group).

Typically, this is the course teacher or a person authorized by the course teacher with access to the Teacher's Notebook. Anyone can be the administrator of a non-course ROPOT.\nThe Record\nBy a record is meant a user who responds a ROPOT (a respondent, typically student) or a compiled test sheet not linked any to student yet.\nSession\nThe user creates the session by clicking on the \"Launch a new ROPOT application\" button, the system creates the assignment and starts the test. For each session, the date, time, and all operations made during a session are recorded.\nOperations\nThe operation means opening, saving, submitting, viewing by respondent and changing the marking of right/wrong answers in the evaluation section by teacher. The system records all operations that are performed on the ROPOT session.\nSession in progress\nIf a respondent launches the ROPOT, fills in at least one answer and saves it using “Save and continue” button, and does not use the \"Submit\" button, this session is marked as a session in progress. It is desirable that the sessions do not remain in progress, as only after submission will the test be evaluated (and the result written in the notebook, if required). A turquoise icon with an exclamation mark indicates a session in progress. An in-progress session can be ended either by the respondent submitting the test or by the teacher changing the save to submit in the session (for a tool to end a work-in-progress session, see the handling key icon – i. e. “Edit session” button).\nMismatch in number of started sessions, session reopened, session still unanswered\nThis is supplementary information, especially for cases where a student reports difficulty working with the answer key. They are notifications\n of a non-standard number or order of some operations. Mismatch in the number of started sessions highlights situations where there has been a mismatch\n in the number of times the ROPOT has been opened and submitted or vice versa. Re-opened session highlights a situation where the respondent has already\n submitted their answers at least once in the sessione, but then returned to the test again by clicking on 'Re-answer' and has not yet made any\n changes to their answers since then. For the passage with no answers so far, the answerer has made a new assignment but has not filled in any answers.\nOpened\nThe date and time of launching the ROPOT session by respondent is recorded accordingly. For a compiled test sheet, it indicates the date and time the compiled test sheet was created (typically a compiled test sheet for scannable exam).\nSaved\nIt records the date and time when the respondent used the \"Save and Continue\" button or when the continuous save occurred automatically.\nSubmitted\nThe date and time when the respondent clicked on the \"Submit\" button and the ROPOT session was evaluated, or when the session was automatically submitted at the end of the time limit for taking the test, is recorded\nViewed\nThe date and time at which the respondent viewed their answers is recorded. The ability to view responses and possibly see which ones are correct is set by the ROPOT administrator.\nCorrection\nRecord the date and time when the teacher made a change of the marking of right/wrong answers in the evaluation section of the answers (for at least one question, the teacher changed which answer was correct and the points were recalculated).\nLast important operation\nIt is either opened, saved or submitted.

        "title": "What should I know if I want to organize a PC-based test for my students?",
        "answer": "The agenda can be used for testing in the computer classroom. Students fill in a form in the IS, which itself corrects the exam. If the test includes free-form answers (which the system cannot correct automatically), the teacher will correct them manually later. The test is not accessible before the start of the exam.\nYou can limit the time for taking the test, ither by the total number of minutes or by setting the day and hour from-to which the ROPOT can be worked with, or a combination of both (see above).\n\n        \n        If you limit the time for working with the ROPOT, the answers will be automatically submitted after the time limit expires. Therefore, the answers of students who did not save the test using the \"Submit\" button are not lost.\n        \n        \nTipIf you want to use the ROPOT for the real exam for grades, use the services of an e-technician – he/she will advise and check that everything is set up correctly.\n\nOrganization of ROPOTs for multiple examination dates\nMake these decisions:\n\n        Do I want to use one assignment for multiple examination dates?\n Do I want the student to not be able to view the assignment questions in any way after submitting the test?\n\n        Depending on the level of \"uniqueness\" you require, you need to create as many ROPOTs as you need. The usual procedures are: \n\n        Each examination date has a unique assignment stored in a separate question set, the test questions are mixed (each student sees them in a different order)\n        For example, there are three different question sets, each set to be used on multiple examination dates.\n        There is only one assignment = question set.\n\n        How many ROPOTs:\nAccess to a single ROPOT can be \"given and taken\" over time. It can be made accesible on Mondays 8.00-9.00, then 14.00-15.00, etc., as the examination dates are organized. A student who has already taken the test cannot change the answers, but can look at the wording of the questions should he/she reopen the ROPOT when the next examination date is in progress. \n\nThis can be avoided if you restrict access to the ROPOT to a specific part of the computer network (the classroom – LVT department will help),  so that it is not freely accessible from the internet. If you cannot use this restriction and do not want students to be able to return to the assignment, create a separate ROPOT description for each examination date.\n        Security mechanisms\nFind out from the technical support of the computer room the range of addresses of the computer network of the classroom (the so-called IP addresses) and enter them in the description of the ROPOT– the section   \"On which computers should the students be allowed to work with the ROPOT application?\". The student can also give you the address of the computer individually, it can be found under\n\n        \nInformation system   System   Remote client IP address\n\n        If you don't want or can't find out the IP addresses, you can do the following: \n        Use the regular examination dates application to divide students into examination dates, set up \"log in\" and \"log out\" dates well before the exam date so that someone can't log in at the last minute and open the test (view the test questions).\n        In the description of the ROPOT, under \"Rights and time group\", specify that only those with a reservation on a specific examination date can open it.\n        At the beginning of the exam, check attendance and remove those students who are absent from the examination date reservation (so that they do not open the ROPOT from the internet during the exam).\n\n        You can also use other security mechanisms: \nYou can specify in the ROPOT description that a wide coloured column should appear on the left side of the screen when the ROPOT is launched. \n\n\n        \n\n1 A coloured column in the ROPOT as part of the security measures.\n\n       It allows you to remotely check that everyone is working with the correct ROPOT only. You can choose the colour of the column to distinguish e.g. individual test dates.\n        If you have set up the display of the left column (see the previous paragraph), the identity of the respondent, i.e. the name, učo and photo of the person logged in, will also be displayed. This will make it easier to check the identity of the respondent.\n        \n        You can contact the faculty CIT  to ask if it would be possible to  disable access to other sites than \n is.muni.cz.\nWhat else is good to know...\nThe student cannot unknowingly open the ROPOT twice (e.g. by double-clicking). If such a situation occurs, MU IS will ask the student whether he/she really wants to open the ROPOT a second time. The same question will be asked if the student wants to open the unsaved test in two browser windows or panels. Whether he/she will be able to do this depends on the setting of the parameters in the ROPOT description,\n        but the ROPOT cannot be reopened and the answers cannot be continued/changed if the setting is \"no (once you open the ROPOT, you cannot reopen the ROPOT sometime later and change the answers)\"..\n        \n        Students have a \"Save and continue\" button to prevent inconveniences caused by power outages, etc. If you set in the ROPOT description for the test to have multiple pages, “save and continue” is done automatically when a respondent moves between pages. It also occurs when a respondent presses the \"Enter\" key. However, only the final submission,  is the decisive moment for\n        the evaluation of the test and the allocation of points..\n        \n        The system records all operations that have been performed (time of launching the ROPOT, computer address, answers chosen, time of submission, viewing the answers, etc.). In the event of problems or suspected malpractice, these data can be found. \n        \n        If a student accidentally submits a session for evaluation, they typically cannot return to the test. A possible solution is to remove his/hers answers with the application \n        \nInformation system   Teacher   [course selection]   Work with ROPOT   Remove answers\n\n        and let him/her launch the ROPOT all over again. \n        \n\n\t\n        If you are new to testing or are unsure of your ROPOT setup, feel free to contact your  e-technician. We will review the ROPOT description and recommend the best combination of ROPOT parameters for your needs. You can avoid unpleasant situations where the combination of inappropriate parameters would make the ROPOT not behave as you want.\n",

Until then, the student will not see the scores for each question. If you still want to tell him/her the overall result, use the transfer of the scores to the notebooks (see above).\n          never:  the student will not see the correct solution, a typical setting for real testing. \nIt can be enabled to show scores in the session list.\n          display all the answers after x attempts (unless all the questions are answered correctly earlier): the aim is to make students think more about their possible mistakes in the practice test by preventing them from viewing the correct results immediately after the first attempt. Instead, they have the opportunity to take the test several times, knowing that they did not get everything right. If an option is set that allows multiple different sessions to be generated at the same time, attempts are counted separately for each session generated.\n               TipThis number of attempts limits only the access to the answers; the student may do the actual answering in more attempts than is the number entered here.\nonly from  –  to (this option is not recommended): the student can only open the correct solution view at the set interval. (If you select the option and do not fill in the values, the student will always view the solution.)\n\nNoteThe time limit for displaying the correct answers does not guarantee that students will not take pictures, email them, etc. Therefore, do not use this option if you have a serious interest in keeping the correct results secret.\n  \n        You can set the possibility to work with the ROPOT repeatedly in the section \"Should students be allowed to access this ROPOT application repeatedly?\": \n        maximum number of times the test can be evaluated (if no number is provided, no limit is applied): the number of test evaluations does not include saves (using “save and continue” button), because these do not result in an evaluation of the test. The test is scored only after it is submitted. \n\n              If you need to count the number of times the ROPOT is launched instead of the number of times it is evaluated, tick the option \"count the number of times the ROPOT application (test) gets opened (not evaluated)“. \n          Yes, they should and some other questions should be offered to them next time they work with the ROPOT application: the term \"session\" means that the student launches a blank, new test. You can set this parameter even if you use all the questions in the question set. In that case, the student will have a clean test in front of him/her again and will have to fill in everything again. If you use only a certain number of questions, the student will work with variations of the test (the selection of questions is random!). \nFor this option, you can disable the ability to answer sessions already launched.\n          Yes, they should, but it is always the same form (same questions) that should be offered to them:  this means that a student can only take the new test once.

Re-opening is not possible even before final submission.\n        \n          No, never (select this option provided the test is to be scanned and you only want to make it available for browsing): this option will not allow the student to lauch the test.

        "title": "I want to limit the time responding students can spend working with the ROPOT",
        "answer": "There are two basic options: specifying the from-to interval and the total number of minutes the ROPOT can be worked with.\n\tSetting the from-to interval (period during which the application can be worked with)\n\t\tYou can select the date and time from and until which the ROPOT can be worked with. You can either enter both data or only one of them. You can set more than one interval for accessing the ROPOT.\n\n\t  Setting the total time for the test\n\t\tAnother option is to specify the total number of minutes that the ROPOT \ncan be worked with. The time is counted for each person separately from the moment the ROPOT session is first launched. Although the teacher can set the student to return to the ROPOT session and work with it repeatedly, the total time is still counted from the first time the ROPOT session is launched.\n\n\t  Combining the two methods\n\t\tYou can combine both types of time restriction. The limit that expires first will apply. For example, you have a ROPOT where the interval is set to 15:00 to 16:00 and 10 minutes. If a student launches the ROPOT at 15:55, they will only have 5 minutes to answer it. If he/she opens it at 15:00, he/she will have 10 minutes.\nThe combination of time constraints can be used, for example, in real examinations for grades. For example, you want to give students 30 minutes of time and at the same time you don't want students to lose some of their time due to a delay in the start of the test. In such a situation it is convenient to set the interval e.g. 10:00–11:30 and at the same time the total number of minutes to 30. Each student will have 30 minutes to work and it does not matter whether he/she opens the test at 10:00 or 10:05. Only students who open the test at 11:01 or later would be disadvantaged.\nYou can do the same in tests designed for practice during the semester. For example, you want students to work with the ROPOT repeatedly over a period of time (e.g., March to May), but only for a limited amount of time (e.g., 20 minutes). In this type of testing, you need to have the parameter \"yes, they should and some other questions should be offered to them next time they work with the ROPOT application\". This is because if you set it to \"yes, they should, but it is always the same form (same questions) that should be offered to them\", the time from the first time the ROPOT session is launched is counted. In our case, if the student saved the test after 10 minutes and came back to it after half an hour, he/she would not be able to work with it anymore because the 20 minutes would have passed in the meantime.\nMultiple periods during which the ROPOT can be worked with is useful in the case of tests on multiple dates for different groups or seminars within a course or courses using shared study materials. This eliminates the need to create multiple ROPOT descriptions for a single test that is intended for different groups of students. It is also important that all groups of students who are to work with the ROPOT at a given time also have the appropriate rights assigned. For example, you want to give one test to two groups of students. The first examination date is at 10:00, the second at 14:00. In the ROPOT description, you set the date and time in the first line to, for example, 10:00–11:00, and in the second line to 14:00–15:00. Thus, one description is used for two examination dates.\nWith both types of time constraints, the student can see how much time is left. For the last 5 minutes, a red warning appears on the counter indicating the end of the test and flashes for the last minute.\n\n\n1 Students see that the time for answering the ROPOT is coming to an end.\n",

        "answer": ":: l ::Direct entry of an algebraic expression:\n\nThis type of question is designed for mathematical questions that require the student to answer with an algebraic expression. The correctness of the answer is checked using the Maple program, allowing, for example, to correctly evaluate different notations of the same expression (e.g., \"1/2*sin x\" a \"sin(x)/2\"). Therefore, in order to evaluate the question, the student must write the answer in Maple syntax.\n\n        The correctness checking of the answer can be influenced by a whitelist and a blacklist of allowed and disallowed functions or procedures that may or may not appear in the answer. You can make only certain functions available to students for an answer or prevent Maple from calculating its own answer using a Maple function.\n        The definition of a question is similar to the :t and :tt types, where the number of underscores after the \":l\" character determines the length of the input field.  \n        The following examples show how to use whitelist and blacklist.\n        \nExample question with whitelist:\n        Derive the function <M>f(x)=cos(2*x)</M>\n        :l_________________\n        :l=\"-2*sin(2*x) w[sin, cos]\" ok \n(Only the sine and cosine functions can be used for the answer.)\n\nExample question with blacklist:\n        Derive the function <M>f(x)=x^5</M>\n        :l_________________\n        :l=\"5*x^4 b[diff, Diff]\" ok \n(You cannot use the derivation function to specify a derivative expression.)\n\n        If neither whitelist nor blacklist is used in the answer definition, the so-called authoring solution is used, which automatically uses the whitelist from the functions used in the correct variant.\n        You can use HTML tags in the assignment, and the HTML editor for the question assignment. Mathematical expressions are entered using LaTeX notation in the <M> tag, and are planted in the figure. Ex. notation <M>T_e=10^8 K, n_0=10^{19} m^{-3}</M>.\n        Points: for defining the correct answer, type 'ok' to indicate that this answer is correct. The number of points scored can be further specified by number or percentage, e.g.\n        2\n        -2\n        50%\n        -25%\n        The percentage is calculated from the value entered in the ROPOT description.\nTipYou can watch a demo of creating a :l question in the answer key in this video.\n        \n\tYou can see the usefulness and applicability of the :l question in\n        the sample ROPOT.\n        \n        You can use the Question Editor to create :l questions.\n        \n        In case of problems with LaTex, the Input Tuning application for Tex2img is available (authenticated). \n        \nNoteEvaluation of the correctness of this type of question is not provided by the MU IS. Answers are sent to an external server where the correctness is evaluated by a script and the result is transmitted back to MU IS.

Veškeré manipulační prvky uvedené v zadávací části je nutné definovat také v hodnotící části, kdy alespoň jedna varianta odpovědi musí být označena jako správná (s výjimkou manipulačních prvků :h, :a).\nNepovinně smí otázka obsahovat název, body a zpětnou vazbu odpovídajícímu. V zadávací části (včetně případných nabízených možností) lze volitelně využít také HTML formátování, matematické výrazy, obrázky a multimédia.\nNásledující část se věnuje popisu prvků, které může otázka obsahovat, a jednotlivým základním typům otázek.\nNázev ::\nPřed zadávací částí otázky smí být uveden její název. Název otázky se odpovídajícímu zobrazuje tučně. Zadává se mezi dvě dvojice dvojteček, např.:\n::Jesus' hometown::Jesus Christ was from\n :c1 Nazareth\n :c2 Nazereth\n :c3 Bethlehem\nNázev otázky je jedinou výjimkou z jinak platného pravidla, že v zadávací části nesmí žádný řádek začínat dvojtečkou.\nZadávací část\nNemá-li otázka název, tak její zadávací část začíná se začátkem definice testové otázky. V zadávací části otázky se popisuje, v jakém tvaru má odpovídající otázku vidět včetně způsobu zobrazení případných možností, které se mu nabídnou.\nV následujícím textu je uveden výčet jednotlivých základních manipulačních prvků, které odpovídají základním typům otázek (a které lze zároveň vložit formulářem). Vyučující při zadávání otázky určuje, jaké manipulační prvky se mají pro zadání odpovědi použít.\nSeznam manipulační prvků:\nRadio tlačítka – Typ otázky pro výběr právě jedné správné odpovědi z více možných. Radio tlačítka používají manipulační prvek :r (zkratka z radio button). \n\n  \n\nZaškrtávátka – Typ otázky pro výběr alespoň jedné správné odpovědi z více možných. Zaškrtávátka používají manipulační prvek :c (zkratka z checkbox). \n\n  \n\nVýběr z nabídky v roletce – Typ otázky pro výběr právě jedné z možností v roletce. Každá z roletek může obsahovat naprosto odlišné možnosti. Roletka s výběrem možností používá manipulační prvek \n :v (zkratka z výběr). \n\n  \n\nTextový řádek – Typ otázky, kdy do textových řádků (polí) odpovídající vyplňuje jedno nebo více slov. Jedno textové pole může být nanejvýš jeden řádek dlouhé. Textové řádky používají manipulační prvek \n\n :t (zkratka z textline). \n\n  \n\nNumerické pole – Numerické pole je podobným typem otázky jako textový řádek, ovšem s rozdílem, že v hodnotící části lze kromě samotného čísla zadat také interval, do kterého musí číslo zadané odpovídajícím spadat, aby byla odpověď hodnocena jako správná. Lze zadávat i reálná čísla s desetinnou tečkou nebo čárkou. Numerické pole používá manipulační prvek \n\n\n :n (zkratka z number). \n\n  \n\nPřiřazení možností – Typ otázky pro přiřazení možnosti do dvojice s výrazem v zadání. Všechny roletky obsahují úplně stejné možnosti. Přiřazení možností používá manipulační prvek  \n\n\n\n\n :m (zkratka z matching). \n\n  \n\nSlovosled – Typ otázky, kdy odpovědí je seřazení slov do věty ve správném slovosledu. Slovosled používá manipulační prvek    \n :s (zkratka ze slovosled). \n\n  \n\nTextová oblast – Typ otázky s textovou oblastí pro vepsání delšího neformátovaného textu, eseje apod.   Textová oblast používá manipulační prvek\n :a (zkratka z textarea). \n\n  \n\nTextová oblast s formátovaným textem – Typ otázky s textovou oblastí pro vepsání textu, kde je hodnoceno i použité formátování (např. u citací). Textová oblast s formátovaným textem používá manipulační prvek \n \n :h. \n\n  \n\nOdpověď skrytá klíčem – Typ otázky, kdy odpovídající nic nevyplňuje. Na otázku nejprve zkusí sám odpovědět a poté si zobrazí správnou odpověď. Odpověď skrytá klíčem používá manipulační prvek \n\n :b (zkratka z blind). \n\n  \n\nAlgebraický výraz – Typ otázky, který umožňuje vyhodnotit správnost algebraického výrazu zapsaného odpovídajícím v syntaxi programu Maple. Odpovědi vyhodnocuje externí server. Algebraický výraz používá manipulační prvek \n  :l. \n\n  \n\nVyhodnocení algoritmu externím serverem – Typ otázky, u kterého odpovídající vyplní algoritmus, jehož správnost vyhodnotí externí server provozovaný učitelem. Správná odpověď je taková, která vyhodnotí odpovídajícím vepsaný algoritmus na zadaných hodnotách shodně. Vyhodnocení algoritmu externím serverem používá manipulační prvek \n \n  :e. \n\n  \n",

        "answer": "V jedné otázce je možné využít více manipulačních prvků stejného typu, u některých typů lze mít podotázky, případně lze v rámci otázky kombinovat některé typy manipulačních prvků navzájem. V takových případech je ale nutné jednotlivé manipulační prvky (a případné odpovědi nabízené v jejich rámci) jednoznačně identifikovat. Příklady níže popisují základní vlastnosti manipulačních prvků a jejich zobrazení v testu.\nKromě označení svého typu takto může manipulační prvek obsahovat upřesnění ve formě čísla (je-li více prvků stejného typu) a písmena (jsou-li k prvku nabízeny podotázky), a to vždy v pořadí: manipulační prvek – číslo – písmeno, tedy např. :r1a.\nPokud je v otázce jen jeden manipulační prvek, není nutné žádné další upřesnění, např.:\nDoplňte odpovídající slovo: jaro, léto, podzim, :t\n:t=zima ok 2\n(V otázce se zobrazí jediné textové pole.)\n\nČíslo v manipulačním prvku\nPokud je v otázce více manipulačních prvků stejného typu, které neobsahují podotázky, je potřeba je jednoznačně identifikovat pomocí čísla, např.:\nDoplňte odpovídající slovo: pondělí, úterý,  :t1___ , čtvrtek,  :t2___ , sobota, neděle.\n:t1=\"středa\" ok\n:t2=\"pátek\" ok\n(V otázce se zobrazí dvě textová pole.)\nJednoznačné označení manipulačního prvku umožňuje také definovat přidělené body a zpětnou vazbu k vybrané možnosti, např.:\nJe Brno hlavní město České republiky?\n :r1 ano\n :r2 ne\n:r1 Kéž by bylo.\n:r2 ok Bohužel.\n(Manipulační prvky oddělené mezerou od začátku řádku označují nabízené možnosti v zadávací části, prvky začínající dvojtečkou na začátku řádku označují vyznačení správné odpovědi a zpětnou vazbu v hodnotící části.)\nČíslo a písmeno u manipulačního prvku s podotázkou\nJe-li součástí určitého manipulačního prvku více podotázek, tak je potřeba jej vždy upřesnit pomocí písmena za číslem. Otázka s více manipulačními prvky stejného typu, kdy v rámci každého prvku jsou nabízeny nějaké možnosti odpovědi, potom vypadá např. takto:\nDoplňte odpovídající slovo: pondělí, úterý,  :v1a , čtvrtek,  :v1b , sobota, neděle.\n:v1a=\"středa\" ok\n:v2a=\"pátek\"\n:v3a=\"neděle\"\n:v1b=\"čtvrtek\"\n:v2b=\"pátek\" ok\n:v3b=\"sobota\"\n(V otázce se zobrazí dvě roletky, každá bude nabízet tři možnosti, z nichž vždy právě jedna je správná.)\nKonkrétní manipulační prvek v otázce (roletku) jednoznačně určuje písmeno za číslem (:v1a), tedy například o kolikátou roletku v otázce jde. Číslo uvedené za manipulačním prvkem s podotázkou (:v1a) označuje přesnou možnost odpovědi nabízenou v rámci prvku, např. o kolikátou možnost v roletce jde. V příkladu výše proto v zadávací části otázky bude vždy „:v1_“.\nV následujícím příkladu jsou v rámci jedné testové otázky tři podotázky (na každém řádku jedna), které se však hodnotí společně jedním bodovým hodnocením:\nKteré jednotky určují čas?\n    hodina      metr\t kilogram\n     :r1a\t:r2a\t   :r3a\n    joule      sekunda\t   bar\n     :r1b\t:r2b\t   :r3b\n    kelvin\trok\t  pascal\n     :r1c\t:r2c\t   :r3c\n:r1a:r2b:r2c ok\nMožností s radio tlačítky pak lze vybrat více a zobrazí se následovně:\n\n",

Tzn. že se zachovají všechny nové řádky, všechny mezery, písmo neproporcionální, tzn. stejné formátování jako ve zdrojovém textu definice testové otázky.\nKromě toho je v zadávací části možné využít také jen samostatné HTML formátovací značky, např. <b>…</b>, <br> apod.",

Také je zde uvedeno, které možnosti jsou správné, nepovinně pak bodové hodnocení jednotlivých možností a zpětná vazba. Hodnotící část otázky obsahuje alespoň jeden hodnotící řádek.\nŘádek v hodnotící části typicky začíná manipulačním prvkem (případně značku pro nezodpovězenou otázku nebo pro nedefinovanou odpověď). Dále mohou následovat: vyznačení správnosti (ok), body, zpětná vazba, a to přesně v tomto pořadí. Hodnotící řádek může obsahovat všechny tři tyto části, jen některé nebo žádnou z nich. Na řádku se vzájemně oddělují mezerou.\nManipulační prvky v hodnotící části\nHodnotící řádek s manipulačním prvkem obsahuje jednoznačně identifikovaný manipulační prvek (tzn. nabízenou možnost), případně všechny prvky, které odpovídající musí vyznačit zároveň. Nepovinně řádek obsahuje vyznačení správnosti, bodové hodnocení řádku a zpětnou vazbu, která se odpovídajícímu vypíše, pokud vyznačil všechny manipulační prvky definované na daném řádku.\nVždy alespoň jeden hodnotící řádek v otázce musí být označen jako správná odpověď textem „ok“. Tzn. každý manipulační prvek uvedený v zadávací části musí být definovaný v hodnotící části, kde u něj na (alespoň) jednom řádku musí být uvedeno ok. Výjimkou jsou manipulační prvky :a a :h, které mají definovanou jen zadávací část. Podrobněji o vyznačení správnosti a bodování viz níže.\nManipulační prvek či prvky v hodnotící části se zadávají na začátku řádku, od kterého se nesmějí oddělovat mezerou (takový řádek tedy začíná dvojtečkou). Stejně tak se od sebe navzájem neoddělují mezerou v případě, pokud je na jednom řádku uvedeno více manipulačních prvků zároveň.\nVlastnosti jednotlivých manipulačních prvků v hodnotící části\nDále jsou uvedena specifika jednotlivých typů manipulačních prvků.\nV případě manipulačních prvků :r a :c se v hodnotící části povinně definují pouze prvky (tzn. nabízené možnosti) nebo jejich kombinace, které jsou označeny jako správné, například takto:\nJe Brno hlavní město České republiky?\n :r1 ano\n :r2 ne\n:r2 ok\n\nNepovinně lze u těchto dvou typů prvků definovat ty prvky, které jsou hodnoceny explicitními body nebo je u nich zadaná zpětná vazba.\nV hodnotící části manipulačního prvku :v (roletka s výběrem) je povinné vyjmenovat všechny možnosti, ze kterých si má odpovídající vybírat.\n Text možnosti zadaný v uvozovkách se zobrazí jako položka v roletce. Každá nabízená možnost musí být jednoznačně identifikovaná, viz otázka\n „Vlastnosti manipulačních prvků ve zdrojovém textu definice otázky v sadě“. Zároveň je potřeba pro každou roletku (prvek „:v1_“ v zadávací části) označit alespoň jednu možnost jako správnou, například:\nDoplňte velikost písmen:  :v1a eská  :v1b epublika\n:v1a=\"Č\" ok\n:v2a=\"č\"\n:v1b=\"R\"\n:v2b=\"r\" ok\n\nV hodnotící části manipulačního prvku :t se povinně definuje text správné odpovědi. Může jít o slovo nebo o řetězec více slov. Odpověď vyplněná odpovídajícím se vyhodnotí jako správná právě tehdy, když bude v textovém řádku vepsané shodné slovo nebo řetězec slov, který je na hodnotícím řádku označený jako „ok“. V popisu odpovědníku pak lze nastavit, zda se má v hodnocení správnosti vyplněné odpovědi zohledňovat také diakritika a velká písmena. Například:\nDoplňte odpovídající slovo:\njaro, léto, podzim, :t________\n:t=\"zima\" ok\n\nPříklad s více správnými odpověďmi:\nPřeložte do angličtiny: \"Je to pěkná zahrada.\"\n :t_________________________\n:t=\"It is a nice garden.\" ok\n:t=\"It's a nice garden.\" ok\n\nV hodnotící části manipulačního prvku :n se také povinně definuje správná odpověď, kterou může být číslo nebo číselný interval. Oboje může obsahovat desetinnou čárku nebo desetinnou tečku. Odpověď vyplněná odpovídajícím se vyhodnotí jako správná tehdy, když se číslo vepsané do odpovědního pole shoduje s definovanou správnou odpovědí v hodnotící části nebo spadá do definovaného intervalu, například:\nUveďte Ludolfovo číslo pí s přesností na 3 desetinná místa :n1\n:n1=3.141..3.142 ok\n\nZápis „3.141..3.142“ na hodnotícím řádku znamená, že jako správná odpověď se vyhodnotí jakékoli číslo, které patří do intervalu 3,141–3,142. Dolní a horní hranice intervalu se od sebe odděluje dvojicí teček „..“.\nV hodnotící části manipulačního prvku :m je potřeba definovat správné odpovědi. Na rozdíl od prvku :v zde nejsou žádné možnosti navíc, jeden prvek (např. :m1) má právě jednu správnou odpověď.\nPokud odpovídající musí současně vybrat všechny správné možnosti, aby byla celá otázka hodnocena jako správně zodpovězená, je potřeba všechny tyto možnosti zadat na jeden řádek, tedy:\nVyberte hlavní město ke státu:\n Kanada   :m1\n Itálie   :m2\n Japonsko :m3\n Indie\t  :m4\n:m1=\"Ottawa\":m2=\"Řím\":m3=\"Tokyo\":m4=\"New Delhi\" ok\n\nStejně tak jde otázku hodnotit po částech:\nVyberte hlavní město ke státu:\n Francie   :m1\n Itálie   :m2\n Německo :m3\n Velká Británie\t  :m4\n:m1=\"Paříž\" ok\n:m2=\"Řím\" ok\n:m3=\"Berlín\" ok\n:m4=\"Londýn\" ok\n\nManipulační prvek typu :s je specifický v tom, že nemusí mít definovanou zadávací část, která se v takovém případě vytvoří z prvního řádku hodnotící části. Proto textová forma celého zadání otázky s tímto manipulačním prvkem může vypadat například takto:\n:s=\"this|is|a nice|garden\" ok\n\nPro manipulační prvky typu :a a :h není možné definovat správnou odpověď v hodnotící části. Odpovědi, které odpovídající u těchto otázek vyplní, nelze vyhodnotit automaticky. Vždy je proto nutné je vyhodnocovat ručně.\nManipulační prvek :b je specifický v tom, že u této otázky odpovídající nemohou nic vyplnit. V hodnotící části v tomto případě není definována správná odpověď, ale skrytý text, který se zobrazí po kliknutí na klíč. Skrytý text je povinnou součástí hodnotící části, ale není označený jako „ok“. Jsou-li zadané body za nezodpovězenou otázku, tak se u tohoto typu použijí. Příklad otázky:\nMěsta mám, domy žádné, lesy mám, stromy žádné, vody mám, ryby žádné.\n :b\n:b Je to mapa.\n\nU manipulačních prvků :l a e: je v hodnotící části za definicí správné odpovědi potřeba označit „ok“.

        "answer": "Peer Assessment is an application in the MU IS implementing the pedagogical assessment process where students evaluate each other. In the English-language literature, this concept is known as \"peer assessment\" or, less precisely, \"peer review\".\nThe basic difference between the above-mentioned terms lies in the choice of the so-called evaluators, i.e. the persons responsible for assessing the submitted work and drawing up an opinion. Whereas in the peer assessment process, the submitter and the assessors are typically students and often come from the same set of individuals, in the case of peer review, the assessors are carefully selected from among experts in the field with the aim of providing a qualified and impartial review of the submitted scientific work while ensuring a high degree of relevance. The basic mechanism for the collection and distribution of files and results is identical for both use cases.",

        "answer": "There are a number of reasons to incorporate student peer assessment into teaching. The following list outlines at least some of them:\n     In the process of producing their assessments, students develop their critical thinking skills, their ability to look objectively at others' work and to produce constructive criticism.\n      Students get feedback not only from the teacher, the authority figure, but also from colleagues - their criticism can be more easily accepted by students.\n        Evaluators can also be students of a completely different course, e.g. from a higher year, for whom it may be part of their preparation for a teaching career or an opportunity to improve further professional competences.\n        The application also allows specifying individual persons as assessors, so that the teacher can distribute the correction of assignments among his/her doctoral students or colleagues who do not teach the course .\n      The teacher can easily get more assessments of any number of papers as the number of assessors increases with the number of students.\n       When students assess other students, they are actively engaged in the learning process. Creating a good assessment naturally requires a good knowledge of the field, which can lead them to further learning. If they process multiple papers by their peers, they have the opportunity to gain insight into the thinking of a number of students who have worked on the same or similar assignments.",

        "title": "How do I set up a peer assessment?",
        "answer": "In the Peer Assessment application\n     Information system  Teacher  [course selection]  (Peer assessment)  Administrator\n    you need to click on the \"Create new\" option. The text in this section of the help only deals with the type of peer assessment where both submitters and evaluators are individuals. The specifics of peer assessment with groups are addressed in the question How do I set up a peer assessment where the submitters or evaluators are groups?\nThe setting up of the peer assessment is divided into five points (or steps):\nName of the peer assessment: Filling in basic information such as the name, instructions for submitters, date the peer assessment will be made available to the submitters (i.e. the date when the peer assessment is displayed in the MU IS to submitters, not when the distribution of files takes place or the assessment begins), setting up the sending of informational emails, specifying the hidden identity of the submitting student(s) or evaluator(s), etc. \n        \nSubmission: setting up a new homework vault or selecting from existing ones. In the case of setting up new homework vault, you need to set a date by which students can submit their files. Only students who have uploaded at least one file to at least one of the selected homework vaults are considered as submitters during distribution.\n        \nEvaluator selection: in the simplest case, just turn on the \"Submitters are evaluators\" mode. Alternatively, you can specify the evaluators as students of courses or seminar groups, or individually specified by UIN (učo). Only those courses are offered for which the teacher has the right. The IS remembers the settings and evaluates the real persons only at the moment of distributing the files to the evaluators. Peer assessment can therefore be set up at the very beginning of the semester.\nIf one student submits multiple files (even to multiple homework vaults), the evaluator will have all files from that student. In other words, evaluators are \"assigned\" submitters, not individual files.\n\nSet assessment attributes: the teacher must specify the start and end of the assessment and how many times one submitter should be assessed, or how many submitters should be assigned to one assessor. In the \"Enable the evaluation of instructor's file\" section, it is possible to set the teacher's assessment files (see question here). All settings must be feasible at the time of distribution or the distribution will fail. This step can also be used to set a later date for the results to be published to students than the end of the assessment. If the results are transferred to notebooks, the results will be published on this date. \n\nCreate evaluation form: The teacher has an advanced WYSIWYG (informal \"what you see is what you get\") evaluation form editor. Here, the teacher can specify a series of questions that he/she then guides the evaluator through in creating their evaluation. There are questions with one or more possible answers, free text, marking and scoring. For each question, the teacher can specify whether its value is to be stored in the student's notebook. \n",

        "answer": "Peer assessment allows for the following basic combinations:\nThe submitters and evaluators are groups\n      Submitters are groups, evaluators are individuals\n      Submitters are individuals, evaluators are groups\n      The submitters and evaluators are individuals\nIn the application\n     Information system  Teacher  [course selection]  (Peer assessment)  Administrator\n     you need to click \"Create new\" and under the first step \"Name of the peer assessment\" select \"Enable group assessments\". The whole process of setting up a peer assessment is divided into five steps (or points), which are described in detail in the question How do I set up a peer\nassessment? This section of the help focuses on the settings in steps 2 and 3, which are different for group peer assessments.\nPeer assessment, which has group assessments enabled, allows the following settings for submitters and evaluators to form groups:\n\n     Without sorting into groups – Individual students are the submitters or evaluators, not groups.\n      Sort students randomly – Peer assessment will set up a topic list with a sufficient number of groups (topics) and assign students to them randomly.\n      Students sign in on their own – Peer assessment will set up a topic list with enough groups (topics) but will not sign up any students.\n      Sort students into groups manually – The teacher (i.e. the peer assessment administrator) creates groups by entering a list of students‘ UIN (učo) into the peer assessment editing window. He/she can also directly edit the names of the future groups.\n      Použít existující rozpis (i.e. Use an existing topic list) – The teacher selects a topic list that he/she has previously created in the Topic Lists application for the course. The topic list will be linked directly to the peer assessment. A single topic list can only be linked to one peer assessment using this option, and only topic lists that can be linked in this way are offered.\n      Copy existing groups – Here the teacher selects a topic list that he/she has already created in the course in the Topic Lists application. However, the peer assessment will not directly link this topic list, but a one time copy of it. If groups of an existing topic list are to be used for peer assessment a second or more time, this option must be selected.\n        Any changes to the group names, student sign in, etc. must be made on these copied groups, not on the original topic list, if they are to be reflected in the peer assessment. If students are allowed to modify the existing topic list, they must be informed.\nTo divide students into groups, peer assessment uses the Topic Lists application in the course Teacher's Notebook, where the groups are the topics in the course topic list and the students registered for the topic are members of the group so named. In most cases, however, there is no need to set up anything in Topic Lists.\nMembers of the groups can only be students of the course in which the topic list is located or of the courses between which it is shared. If peer assessment is set up for multiple courses, groups are created (or set up) so that students from all courses can be enrolled in them (details below).\nAt the time of the start of the evaluation, the topic lists with groups linked to the peer assessment are locked. This means that they can no longer be edited and will only be available in view mode.\nSimilar to peer assessment for individuals, the setting that the groups submitting are the same as those they are evaluating can be used for groups. Both the submitters and the evaluators assigned to the groups can be students from different courses or seminar groups.\nThe specifics of the groups submitting:\nIf the submitters are grouped, it is highly desirable to check the option for notifying the submitter by email in step 1 \"Name of the peer assessment\", because only then will the application send the students the information that, they have been signed in a group for peer assessment or that they should sign in one.\n      Submission groups are formed on the date and time that the peer assessment is published to students and students are subsequently informed of their signing in or obligation to sign in if this is set in point 1. It is therefore desirable to set the date of publication of the peer assessment well in advance of the submission date.\n      A student is considered a member of a group by the application if he/she joins the group (is enrolled) no later than the start of the evaluation of the files.\n      Application-generated submission groups are created for courses whose students are allowed to upload into one of the linked homework vaults (if they are still allowed to upload) or whose students have a file loaded in one of the homework vaults (if it is an already closed homework vault). The homework vault must be located in the study materials of the course for which the peer assessment is created. If the peer assessment is to be a group assessment for multiple courses, it must be shared, see Is it possible to create a peer assessment that is common to multiple courses?\nA group is considered a (successful) submitter by the application if at least one member submits at least one file to at least one of the connected homework vaults. Such a file is considered to be the work of the whole group.\nThe specifics of the evaluator groups:\nThe groups of assessors created by the \"Sort students randomly\" and \"Sort students into groups manually\" options are created only at the time of distribution of the files to the assessors. Evaluator groups created using the \"Students sign in on their own\" option are created at the date and time the peer assessment is published to students.\n      A student is considered a member of a group by the application if he/she joins the group (is enrolled) no later than the start of the evaluation of the files.\n      The whole group of evaluators has one common evaluation form and it is sufficient for one member of the group to enter the evaluation, as it is assumed that it is the result of joint work. It is recommended that the whole group meets for the evaluation at one computer (or via video call) and one member enters the evaluation for all. The evaluation form does not support simultaneous editing by multiple members of the same group.",

However, the Peer Assessment application does not delete metadata from the submitted files or check their content. Therefore, if the submitter signs directly into their file or leaves metadata in the file (e.g., the author of a Word document), even with pseudonymity set, the evaluator can still reveal the identity of the submitter in peer assessment.\nCourse teachers always know the identity of submitters and assessors.\nPseudonymity is set when a new peer assessment is created:\nInformation system  Teacher  [course]  (Peer Assessment)  Administrator  Create new\nor when editing the peer assessment:\nInformation system  Teacher  [course]  (Peer Assessment)  Administrator  Edit\n\n\n1 Pseudonymity options are in the extension settings, you need to click on \"more\".\n2 Individual pseudonymity options to choose from.\n",

        "answer": "Here it makes a difference whether all students should have peer assessment in one (foreign) language or whether some students should have the same assessment in Czech and some in English.\nIf all students are to have one language version of the peer assessment, whether in English or in another language, it is sufficient to fill in the version of the form otherwise designated for Czech (i.e. the main language of the peer assessment) in the required language, see question 4 above. All setting items, including the evaluation form, can also be filled in languages that use a font other than the Latin alphabet. (The numbers in the distribution priority setting or in the points allocated must always be Arabic.) Similarly, evaluators can use different languages.\nIf some students are to have their peer assessment in Czech and some in English, depending on which language they have switched to in the IS, they need to click the \"+EN\" icon in step 1 of the setup and fill in the items as described. The form for the evaluator in step 5 should also be filled in both in Czech and English.\nInformation emails to submitters and assessors are sent in the language version to which they have switched the IS.",

        "answer": "Yes, if this is set in the peer assessment using the attributes \"[ ] Evaluate the files of the instructor\" and \"[ ] all evaluators\" (Step 4 of Set assessment attributes). If neither of these two attributes is checked, files uploaded by teachers to linked homework vaults are ignored during distribution. That is, the teacher cannot upload a file on behalf of a student (e.g., sent by email) into the homework vault.\nIf the attributes are checked as follows:\n\nthen the teacher who uploads (or submits) at least one file to one of the connected homework vaults will be considered a common submitter during distribution and his/her files will be randomly assigned to one of the evaluators according to the distribution priority setting. In this way, it is possible to test how a random evaluator evaluates the files of a teacher. At the same time, it is also possible to try how the submitting student sees the peer assessment at different stages.\nIf the attributes are checked as follows:\n\nthen the teacher will ensure that all students will also evaluate all teachers' files, and the evaluators will be assigned to evaluate all teachers' files that have submitted at least one file to one of the connected homework vaults, in addition to the number of files set in the distribution priority.\nIf only teacher files are to be evaluated, the frequency should be set to 0 times as the distribution priority.\nFor example, the requirement for assessors to be provided with a model assignment can be addressed in this way.\nThe current application capabilities do not yet allow to solve the requirement when the teacher wants to distribute x files among the students so that one student always receives just one file from the teacher (each evaluator is always assigned all files from the teacher).",

There are no other limitations to peer assessment.\nWhen evaluating a video (or audio recording) created by students, the format they use may be problematic if it cannot be played directly in a browser, or if it can only be played on devices with a particular operating system, etc. As a precaution, we recommend asking students to convert the recorded video (or audio) to HTML5 format, which can be played directly in the browser without downloading, even in peer assessment. If necessary, the teacher can also do this conversion (but not upload the file in the homework vault).\nThe procedure for conversion to HTML5 format is described in detail in the Help here.\nConversion can be done for multiple checked files at the same time.

Vstup do drilové aplikace\n\n      Dril je určen k memorování základních jednotlivých poznatků (např. slovíček) nazpaměť. Je založen na psychologii učení, podle které si poznatky rychleji a kvalitněji zapamatujeme, pokud\nsi je připomínáme méně často, ale zároveň během delší doby. Aplikace funguje na algoritmu, podle kterého jsou poznatky ke zopakování předkládány v okamžiku, kdy je zhruba 90% šance, že si\npoznatek ještě vybavíme. Poznatky je pak třeba opakovat stále řidčeji a za delší dobu, čímž se z krátkodobé paměti přesouvají do dlouhodobé. To znamená, že jste si znalost již osvojili.\n      \n      Dril má tři fáze:\n      fáze učení\nSlouží k učení (memorizaci) nového poznatku. Nezáleží na tom, zda si v této fázi poznatek procvičujete jednou či vícekrát. Zapomínat jej začnete okamžitě a po 15 dnech je až 50%\npravděpodobnost, že jste jej zcela zapomněli.\n      fáze opakování\nDochází k opakování/připomenutí nového poznatku. První opakování by mělo nastat v okamžik, kdy si poznatek na 90% ještě pamatujete, čehož se snaží docílit algoritmus v této aplikaci.\nDalší opakování přichází vždy za o něco delší dobu. Pokud však systému naznačíte (tlačítky 3 až 6 v aplikaci), že si poznatek nepamatujete tak, jak předpokládal, upraví se algoritmus a\nopakování přichází v kratších intervalech.\n      fáze drilování\nV této fázi drilujete poznatky, které jste v předchozí fázi označili tlačítky 3 až 6, tedy poznatky náročnější na zapamatování či naučení. Je to nejdůležitější fáze celého učení,\nneboť poznatky se do dlouhodobé pamětí přesunují právě tím, že si je opětovně vybavíte z krátkodobé paměti.

        "answer": "Scanning handwritten tests is an option a teacher can use if he/she wants students to write the solution to a problem on paper (drawing graphs, pictures, etc.).\nThe teacher can then correct the students' paper solutions and give them a score. \n\n The teacher can write the evaluation comment and points directly on\nthe answer sheets and then scan them in, or if the teacher prefers to\nenter the evaluation comment and points on the computer, he/she can\nscan the answer sheets first and then add the evaluation comment and\npoints in the Responses application.\n\n\n    \n    Students can have multiple problems on multiple sheets of paper. The student writes their answers on the front side of the answer sheet. They can also write on the reverse side, but this is not scanned so the student will not see it in the IS MU.\nOnce the paper has been corrected and marked by the teacher and entered into the IS MU, students can see their answers and the teacher's comments in the IS MU.\n    \nThe basic procedure is illustrated in the following commented video, a\nmore detailed procedure including all options is specified in the text\nbelow:\n\n\n\n    Procedure:\nCreate a ROPOT description for scannable handwritten tests (see ROPOT description).\n    Print out the dispatch form if necessary (see How to prepare the test (test sheets, answer sheets and dispatch form) for students?).\n    Print out enough answer sheets or copy the answer sheet (see How to prepare the test (test sheets, answer sheets and dispatch form) for students?).\n    You can either prepare the assignment on a separate sheet with students writing their answers on printed answer sheets with the header, or you can copy the assignment under the header on the answer sheet. However, you must not interfere with the machine-processable zone (it is marked on the answer sheet).\n    The student fills in the sheet number (e.g. 3 sheets in total – each sheet will have one or more questions) and his/her učo. The student will complete the paper.\n    See\n    \nHelp  Teacher  Tips on examinations based on scannable answer sheets\nCorrect the handwritten test by hand, you can write your comments on the front side. Only the front side is scanned, the reverse side is not scanned. For correcting, you can choose whether you want to correct and scan the paper in colour or black and white. If you choose to scan in black and white to distinguish corrections and teacher comments, it is recommended that you use a thick black marker, for example.\n    Enter the number of points in the box provided. In case you make a mistake and need to correct it, write in pencil and erase any errors. The second way is to write, for example, the letter E instead of a number in a blank, which will cause the error to be reported later. The error can then be corrected manually.\n    Scan the answer sheets with the dispatch form either on your own or with a user support employee. When sending to the IS, place the dispatch form either before or after the scanned papers.\nNoteIf you have corrected the papers in colour, you need to set the scanning program skenovani.exe to scan \"in colour\" instead of \"greyscale\" before you start scanning.\nThe handwritten tests are recognised and checked (see Checking results of recognition process – evaluation of the answer sheets)\n    After checking, the results are entered into the IS. The IS MU will automatically create notebooks for each answer sheet, i.e. in notebook 1 will be the scores of all students from answer sheet 1, in notebook 2 from answer sheet 2, etc. In the notebooks, the scores are entered with an asterisk. \nIn the Teacher's Notebook – using the function \"Add up scores stored in different notebooks\" – will determine the total number of points by adding up the notebooks for sheet 1, sheet 2, etc.\n   \n   If you plan to correct students' answers on your computer (i.e., you\nhave set the ROPOT description to be manually evaluated), then you can\nenter the grading comments and scores in the Responses application,\nwhere you will find a preview of the scanned student answer sheets and\na text box where you can enter verbal comments and scores.\n    Finally, you can enter an evaluation according to the total number of points (see Checking results of recognition process – evaluation of the answer sheets).\n    Scanned answer sheets are placed in the retrieval box for students to review.\n\n\n\n1 Student response.\n2 Teacher's comment.\n3 Number of points awarded, written by the teacher.\n",

Odkazy na zajímavé zdroje v internetu\nmá mnoho učitelů zájem studentům poskytovat - nejčastěji formou souboru\nse seznamem odkazů zavěšeným do Studijních materiálů předmětu.

Zapojení studentů\ndo spoluvytváření informačních zdrojů je v e-learningu trendem. Jako\nučitel můžete například:\n\nvystavit záložky k určitému tématu,\noznačit je štítkem a např. v textu\nstudijního materiálu na ně upozornit - jsou na adrese\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/zkratka_fakulty:kod_predmetu+jmeno_stitku\n\ntj. např.\n\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005!+web\n\nVariantu bez vykřičníku použijete, pokud chcete vyhledat i ty\nzáložky, které k předmětu nevložili učitelé, ale lib. uživatelé:\n\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005+web\n\nvystavit seznam doporučené literatury, jejíž položky jsou dostupné\non-line (články, volně šířené publikace).

Může\nto být pohodlnější, než udržovat seznamy odkazů např. v souborech ve Wordu.\nStudentům jen sdělíte zvolenou konvenci (např. že mají hledat\n„cteni+prvni_tyden“) nebo jim v Interaktivní osnově či jinde připravíte\nodkaz se seznamem pro daný týden;\n\nzadat studentům vyhledat/aktualizovat záložky k určitému\ntématu a strukturovaně je oštítkovat a popsat (vyjádřit, co obsahují,\nproč by na ně čtenář měl klikat, jak jim připadají kvalitní, ...).\nPokud vaši studenti zpracovávají např. referáty k danému tématu, může\nbýt součástí úkolu průzkum a doplnění „Dalšího čtení k tématu“\nprostřednictvím této agendy;\n\nvyzvat studenty, aby si zkopírovali a okomentovali záložku -\nvložte odkaz např. na určitý článek. Pomocí „přidat k mým“ si student\nsnadno odkaz zkopíruje a může u něj vyplnit štítky a popis. Pod odkazem\nnapř. „14 osob“ se pak zobrazuje souborná stránka, kde lze popisy\nzhlédnout. \nNěkdy se v těchto systémech kromě sběru komentářů sbírá také „agregovaný\nnázor“ studentů: v popisu k vloženému článku formulujte dotaz, např. \n„Myslíte si, že autor Platónovo východisko správně pochopil? Vyjádřete\nsvůj názor štítkem ano / ne“ a přidejte k záložce štítky „ano“ a „ne“.\nStudent pak může použít volbu „rychle“, umazat štítek, pro který „nehlasuje“\na záložku si uložit. Cizí štítky jsou u záložky vypsány v pořadí\ndle četnosti použití, tj. je vidět, zda studenti hlasují spíše „ano“\nnebo „ne“.

        "answer": "  \n      In the applications associated with e-learning in the MU IS, the teacher has the opportunity to look at selected MU IS pages from the perspective of a specific student. In this way, the teacher has the opportunity to check that the information entered by him/her into the Notebook has reached the student correctly, that he/she has set up the interactive course syllabus correctly, that he/she has set up the ROPOT parameters correctly, etc. \n      \n      The mechanism was introduced at the request of teachers who wanted to introduce a student identity for testing into the system. However, a student identity for testing would not be usable in this MU IS (unlike other systems) because the person who has enrolled in the course does not have common and uniform student rights (as is usual in other systems), but has individual rights. Students may differ in their study status, seminar group, may have individual rights, etc. \n      \n      A teacher can use someone else's identity via:\n        Information system  Teacher  [course selection] (ROPOTs and Quizzes)  E-learning from a student's point of view\n",

Similarly, the teacher will only see those links and elements in the syllabus that the student actually has the right to read. The readership of the syllabus by the teacher viewing with someone else's identity is not reflected in the readership of the interactive syllabus by the student.\n\n      Study materials\nIt does not indicate information about the reading of a file that the teacher has read with the chosen someone else's identity (i.e. the student will still see the file as unread if the teacher has read it but the student has not).\n\n      Homework Vaults\nThe teacher, under someone else's identity, sees the folders of the homework vaults in the same way as the student, including any file or folder operations offered. So, for example, he or she can check what the homework vault folder tree looks like from the student's point of view and whether the student has sufficient access rights to upload their file. The teacher under someone else's identity cannot upload or manage files on behalf of a student. The teacher can only do this under his/her own identity.\n\n\n      File Manager\nIn the File Manager, the teacher can only choose someone else's identity when viewing the Study Materials. The teacher will not be able to access other people's File Depository etc. When the identity is changed, operations other than viewing or reading cannot be performed in the File Manager. If a teacher attempts to upload a file in the File Manager with a changed identity, the operation will be performed, but the teacher will be listed as the uploader even though someone else's identity remains selected. If the teacher gets to a location where someone else's identity is no longer applied, in addition to the red bar disappearing, an informational message will alert the teacher.\n\n      ROPOTs\nThe teacher can look at the ROPOTs and see if he/she has set the ROPOT correctly. The teacher is not allowed to launch a new ROPOT session or save the answers in behalf of the student. However, the teacher can change the last student’s save operation to submitted in the Responses application in the Teacher's Notebook in special case when the student does not finish his/her ROPOT session by submission of his/hers answers.

Moreover, what attests to the importance of\nthe interaction is that it represents a motivating factor since\nself-study always tends to become rather humdrum after some time and needs to be given some fresh air. Finally, students need someone to answer their questions related\nto the subject matter as well as those pertaining to the ways of using the electronic material.\n\nHowever, the very communication and techniques of maintaining it to the desirable extent may also represent a hindrance\nwhen not handled properly. Teachers are therefore advised to motivate\ntheir students to ask questions and participate in discussions actively.  On the other hand,\nassigning your students too many communication-involving tasks requiring a lot of participation on your part\nmight eventually keep you rather busy.

This is also the reason\nwhy you should use it when sending your students the information you consider important.\nTip: Before entering the Teacher's Notebook of a course,\nyou can select one or more filters to limit the number of students your e-mail will be sent to.\nNotebook: The notebook allows you to enter the student's score or any other information you want\nto communicate to him/her into a text field adjacent to his/her name.\nThe notebook itself can be configured to be either accessible or inaccessible to students.\nFor further information on this application, please see the Help section.\nCourse discussion group: This application can be utilized for discussing the issues related\nto the organization of the course under which it has been created, or a concrete topic. Teachers are allowed to moderate the discussion\nby deleting the contributions they consider irrelevant.\nFor further information on this application, please see the Help section.\nTip: It is advisable to clearly delineate the topic (goal) of the discussion and specify\nthe rules governing it.\nSub-syllabus or discussion thread titled as 'News': Provided you are changing a syllabus\nof your course, it proves convenient to keep all the information on the changes involving, for instance,\ninformation sources, students' duties, etc. in one place. If you do not plan to post a large amount of this information in the future,\nyou can start making it public utilizing a sub-syllabus, which can be displayed to students as expanded by default (a mode you yourself can enable).\nThe advantage of using a sub-syllabus is that it is comparatively easy to navigate in. Provided you, however, expect the information to be extensive, it is advisable to post it\nunder a discussion thread and ask your students to only read it, but not contribute to it.\nFolder titled Course-Related Instructions situated in the Study materials section: Provided your communication with your\nstudents entails the use of large files (or long texts), please make sure you upload them into this folder and instruct the students to keep track of its contents.",

        "answer": "Discussion groups also enable teachers to use some threads for teaching purposes.\nProvided the course has been enrolled in by lots of students, it is advisable to divide them into groups (the seminar groups\ncreated under the course may perfectly serve this purpose) and assign a discussion thread to each of these.\n\nHere are two model situations demonstrating other possible uses of discussion groups:\nA teacher regularly posts under a certain thread some problems that he/she wants his/her students\nto solve and rewards them for correct solutions as well as well-founded criticism of someone else's solution.\nA teacher asks each of his/her students to post a problem of his/her own (e.g. a chemistry experiment\ndesigned for a certain grade of elementary school) and assess the problems posted\nby the others. Eventually, the teacher evaluates the quality of the student's feedback.\n\nUtilizing discussion groups for the aforementioned activities proves useful when you\nhave some experience of moderating your students' discussion since each of them may\nmake multiple contributions and the total number of these may turn out to be rather overwhelming.\nIf this is not the case, you might want to use homework vaults or\ne-surveys instead.\n\t",

This small piece of special data is attached to an electronic document and is used to verify the identity of the sender.\nAn electronic signature can be imagined as such invisible data attached to a file. The program in which the signed electronic document is viewed by the user only alerts him in various ways that there is an electronic signature.\nNoteIf you print the electronically signed document, the electronic signature will not be there. Such a printed document is no longer signed, even though \"nothing has disappeared\" from it.\nFor example, in the IS MU users will encounter an electronic certificate of studies that is signed with an electronic signature.\n\n\n1 For example, students encounter an electronically signed document when generating a certificate of study.\n\n\n\n1 The user can see that the document contains an electronic signature in the program in which the electronic documents are opened.\n",

Pod odkazem „Úprava doplňujících údajů“ z manipulační \n\tstránky Katalogu naleznete rubriky, které kromě pověřených osob typicky vyplňují vyučující.

        "answer": "Kód předmětu\nU nového předmětu zvolte vhodný kód. Kód předmětu nesmí být prázdný, smí obsahovat pouze malá \n\t\ta velká písmena bez diakritiky, podtržítko '_' a nesmí začínat číslicí.\n\t  Není možné, aby dva různé předměty měly tentýž kód a to ani v případě, \n\t\tže první předmět již byl zrušen a nadále se nebude vypisovat. Kontrola průchodu studiem se \n\t\tprovádí vůči absolvovaným kódům; změna významu kódu by tedy měla velmi nepříjemné důsledky. \n\t\tTaktéž měnit již vytvořený kód u daného předmětu se velice nedoporučuje, \n\t\tzejména poté, co začal být předmět vyučován.\n          Určete, kam bude předmět zařazen\nZařazení pomáhá rozdělit kompetence při práci na Katalogu. Osoba, která má právo katal_a na zde \n\t\tuvedené pracoviště, může s ním manipulovat.\n\tVysvětlení: Objektem explicitního práva pro právo katal_a je typicky fakulta, např. 1431 \n\t\tPřírodovědecká fakulta. Takové právo má typicky proděkan fakulty, který má katalog předmětů \n\t\tna starosti. Proděkan zavede nový předmět a předmět bude přiřazen Přírodovědecké fakultě jako \n\t\tcelku. Ovšem proděkan se vzhledem k rozlehlosti fakulty může rozhodnout, že právo katal_a deleguje \n\t\tna více osob, typicky na Přírodovědecké fakultě na studijní vedoucí sekcí. Tyto osoby budou mít \n\t\ttéž právo katal_a, ale objektem jejich práva bude např. 143110 Sekce Matematika. Tito studijní \n\t\tvedoucí mají stejná práva jako proděkan, předměty jimi vytvořené budou předmět přiřazené celé \n\t\tPřírodovědecké fakultě, ale zařazené budou na 143110. Proděkan s objektem 1431 smí modifikovat \n\t\tpředměty 143110. Vedoucí 143110 nesmí modifikovat předměty 143120 ani 1431. Dále, než na \n\t\tšestimístné číslo, objekty drobit nelze. Zařazování předmětů se vztahuje výhradně k právu katal_a. \n\t\tFakulty bez členění tohoto typu (např. FI) nemusí zařazování používat (resp. budou vše zařazovat \n\t\tna úroveň fakulty).\n\t\n\t  Z nabídnutého menu vyberte sekci, ústav či prostě jednotku, které předmět přísluší. Budou ho moci \n\t\tupravovat osoby s právem A nad danou jednotkou.\n          Tlačítko „Zrušit předmět“\nData předmětu budou vymazána. Chcete-li pouze zablokovat použití tohoto předmětu, klikněte na \n\t\t„Nevypisovat“. Poté, co kliknete na „Zrušit“, objeví se potvrzení „skutečně zrušit tento \n\t\tpředmět?“ (zobrazuje se dole, na konci stránky). Pokud znovu neodkliknete „opravdu zrušit“, \n\t\tpředmět zrušen nebude. Předmět lze zrušit pouze v případě, že na něm nejsou navázány další \n\t\taplikace - tj. že si ho dosud nikdo v daném období nezapsal.\n          Vypisovat/nevypisovat tento předmět?\nPředměty, které jsou označeny „nevypsat“, se studentům nenabídnou k registraci a zápisu a nebudou \n\t\tzobrazeny v Prohlídce katalogu.\n          Formulář předvyplnit obsahem jiného předmětu\nV případě, že zakládáte předmět podobný jinému (sestava vyučujících, podobné názvy...) můžete si \n\t\tusnadnit práci zadáním kódu a období vzorového předmětu a stiskem „Dohledat“. Předvyplní se \n\t\tvšechny rubriky kromě rubriky s kódem předmětu.\n          Název\nSekce umožňuje zadat název předmětu ve vyučovacím jazyce. Nemůžete-li správně napsat písmena \n\t\ts diakritikou, obraťte se na své LVT - nemáte správně nakonfigurovaný prohlížeč. \n\t\tV názvech předmětů používejte znak vlnka (~) pro nedělitelnou mezeru. Nedělitelná mezera se \n\t\tv české typografii používá v místech, kde není vhodné zalomit řádek, např. po neslabičné \n\t\tpředložce či iniciále: předmět Dílo A. C. Clarka zaveďte raději Dílo A.~C.~Clarka.\n          Garanční osoba\nZadejte osobu, která předmět garantuje. Typicky jeden z přednášejících. Zde uvedená osoba \n\t\t(musí být z MU) získává právo katal_c pro editaci doplňujících informací o předmětu, stejně jako i další vyučující předmětu.\n \n\t\tKlikněte na „Dohledat“. V případě, že zadanému příjmení odpovídá značné množství záznamů \n\t\t(např. Novák), zadejte přesnější údaj, např. „Jan Novák“. Další rady pro vyhledávání se \n\t\trozbalí po stisku „Návod pro vyhledávání“.\n          Garanční oddělení\nVyberte zodpovědnou katedru či jiné pracoviště. Ponecháte-li pole prázdné, stisk „Dohledat“ \n\t\trozbalí seznam vhodných pracovišť a tlačítko pro případnou další nápovědu. Do vyplňovacího \n\t\tpolíčka též můžete zadat i zkratku pracoviště (platnou v rámci označené fakulty). V každém \n\t\tpřípadě pak před finálním stiskem tlačítka „Ulož“ musíte ještě stisknout nějaké „Dohledat“, \n\t\taby se zkratka převedla na číslo. Pokud byste uložili formulář se zkratkou, systém by odmítl \n\t\tjej přijmout. Ne všechna pracoviště mají již zkratku v našem seznamu zadánu. Můžete poslat \n\t\tseznam vámi užívaných zkratek na adresu istech@fi.muni.cz \n                a budou do seznamu doplněny. Do \n\t\tvyplňovacího políčka můžete též zadat část názvu pracoviště s nahrazovacím znakem „%“, či \n\t\tjinými znaky, obvyklými v tomto významu. Hledá se bez ohledu na diakritiku a velikost písmen.\n          Závěr červených rubrik\nZde končí část, kterou musí povinně vyplnit osoba s právem katal_a.\n\t\t  Vedoucí garančního pracoviště získává možnost editovat zbývající\n\t\t  rubriky předmětu (implicitní právo katal_b), tj. osoba s právem\n\t\t  katal_a nyní může formulář uložit, opustit a přejít k práci na dalším\n\t\t  předmětu.\n",

        "answer": "Aplikace Katalog předmětů udržuje o každém předmětu vyučovaném na MU celou řadu (desítky) údajů. Ani tento rozsah však nepostihuje všechny drobné rozdíly, které se na\ndevíti fakultách mohou vyskytnout. Proto je v Katalogu k dispozici obecný nástroj pro popis předmětů, tzv. volné atributy. Cílem je:\n\tumožnit definovat nové vlastnosti a rubriky Katalogu, informující o rysech předmětu specifických pro určitý obor,\n\t  vypisovat tyto informace při Prohlídce katalogu a zjednodušit studentům orientaci v nabídce předmětů, natahovat předměty označené nějakým atributem do registračních šablon,\n\t  vystavět podle seznamů předmětů s určitými atributy studijní plány a umožnit v pozdější fázi zavedení IS automaticky kontrolovat průchod studiem,\n\t  snadno aktualizovat informace o předmětech a v jarních měsících akademického roku z nich generovat seznamy potřebné pro sazbu Seznamu přednášek.\n\n\tJak mechanismus vypadá v praxi? Garant studijního oboru nadefinuje např. atribut povinně pro MAVT\n\t a označí jím předměty povinné pro tento typ studia. Student kreditového studia při zápisu do semestru volí předměty, které hodlá studovat, a u příslušných předmětů je mu zobrazena i tato dodatečná informace, kterou by jinak obtížně hledal v brožuře (ne vždy zcela aktuální) Studijní program, nebo mu fakulta přímo předpřipraví vhodné předměty do výběrové šablony. Atributy označkovaný Katalog předmětů je propojen s elektronickým zápisem, kde student svou poznámkami garanta usměrněnou volbu realizuje.\n\t",

        "title": "Příklady vhodných atributů",
        "answer": "Systém podporuje atributy tří typů. Logické, jejichž přiřazení předmětu říká, že předmět má danou vlastnost (např. „povinně pro MAVT“), číselné, které se k předmětu přiřazují s hodnotou (např. „náročnost(50)“ by značila středně obtížný/pokročilý předmět na škále 0-100). Třetím typem jsou atributy výčtové, které nabývají přesně definovaných hodnot (např. má-li určitý obor určitá zaměření či profilace, může být vhodné definovat atribut „vhodné pro“ s hodnotami „PA“ (Paleontologie), „AN“ (Antropologie) a podobně).\n\t\n\tVýznam atributů může být nejrůznější. Cílem je, aby pokud možno veškeré utřiditelné informace o předmětu student (či akademická veřejnost vůbec) nemusel hledat jinde. Na počátku práce s\nKatalogem byl všem fakultám předpřipraven logický atribut základ, který se vztahuje k prostupnosti studia. Prosím, označte tímto příznakem ty předměty, které nabízíte k zapsání studentům jiných\noborů či fakult, a jejichž osnovy nepředpokládají hlubší než středoškolské znalosti nebo dovednosti (tj. předměty, které jsou vhodným doplněním obzoru každého vysokoškolského studenta). Tím\nusnadníte výběr posluchačům z MU, kteří mají zájem rozšířit svoje studium o některý doplňující předmět.\n\t\n\tDalšími náměty může být např. oblast náročnosti. Pokud to považujete za účelné, definujte si číselný atribut vyjadřující pokročilost předmětu, nebo výčtový atribut s hodnotami například „pro pokročilé pregraduální studenty“, „pro PGS“. Jiné atributy mohou posloužit při orientaci. Například „vhodné pro diplomanty z AJ“, či výčtový atribut „vhodné pro“ s hodnotami „FR“ (Fyziologie rostlin), „FZ“ (Fyziologie živočichů), ... pro obory, kde se studenti mohou chtít dále profilovat. Zvláštní pozornost je dobré věnovat atributům, které specifikují studijní podmínky. Tak např. podmínka kreditového programu může znít, že do konce studia je zapotřebí získat 4 zápočty z výcvikových kursů, tělesné výchovy či předmětů s TV souvisejících. Atribut „tělocvičné předměty“ pomůže studentům ujasnit si, které to jsou. Obdobně vágní podmínku vyžadující alespoň 10 kreditů z předmětů týkajících se britské literatury lze zpřesnit zavedením atributu, kterým označíte předměty do této kategorie spadající. Dle těchto atributů bude vyhodnocován průchod studiem a studentův nárok na titul č zápis do dalšího semestru.\n\t\n\tObdobně důležité a pro mnoho studentů nedocenitelné jsou atributy specifikující učební plány. Zejména obory s ročníkovým způsobem studia by měly mít nadefinovánu sadu atributů ve tvaru např. (X je označení oboru) „X_kdy(n)“ s hodnotami n 1 až 10, určující, že daný předmět je nutno zapsat v oboru X v n-tém semestru. Kromě toho je výhodné definovat atributy „X_povinné“, „X_p.volitelné“, „X_vhodné“ pro předměty s tímto statutem v oboru X, nebo vytvořit výčtový atribut „povinné(X)“ a nadefinovat hodnoty X jakožto zkratky názvů oborů. Předměty, opatřené atributy souvisejícími se studentovým oborem, mu budou přednostně nabídnuty u elektronického zápisu a registrace, proto je nadefinujte a přiřaďte obzvlášť pečlivě. Označení oboru (X) volte např. zkratkou či číselně, vhodné je mít atributy týkající se jednoho oboru označené jedním prefixem a udržovat systém konzistentní na celé fakultě – lépe se v něm orientuje.\n\t",

        "answer": "Při přípravě kontrolních šablon lze vyjít z šablon registračních, které jsou obvykle členěné na povinné a\n      povinně volitelné předměty. Šablony vytváříme pro studijní obory nebo oborové kombinace. Jelikož se\n      podmínky studia jednotlivých oborů mohou v průběhu let měnit, je rozumné kontrolní šablony oborů navíc\n      dělit na imatrikulační ročníky (např. Politologie → Bakalářská prezenční jednooborová → Imatrikulační\n      ročník 2012/2013). Při přípravě kontrolních šablon je obvyklý tento postup:\n      Vytvořte nový imatrikulační ročník (nová sekce/podúroveň), nastavte příznak „Zde začíná kontrolní\n            šablona“ a vyplňte pole „Nutno splnit podmínek/předmětů z obsahu šablony“ hodnotou „vše“.\n        \n\n1 Nastaveni podmínek.\nVytvořte novou sekci (podúroveň) „Povinné předměty“, u které nastavte pole „Nutno splnit podmínek/\n            předmětů z obsahu šablony“ na hodnotu „vše“.\n        Vytvořte novou sekci (podúroveň) „Povinně volitelné předměty“, u které upřesněte počet potřebných kreditů\n             nastavením podmínky „Nutno splnit kreditů z předmětů šablony“.\n\n      Přiřazení kontrolních šablon studentům provádí Studijní oddělení ve speciální aplikaci.

        "answer": "Some mail servers, such as gmail.com, use the so-called Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to defend against spam. The principle of SPF is that the recipient of the letter (in your case, for example, gmail.com) checks whether the address of the sender of the letter matches the address of the computer from which the letter was actually sent. If it does not match, the recipient may reject the email as undeliverable.\n\nTip: ExampleHere's an example: The user xxx@mail.muni.cz set up in IS MU to redirect mail to\n xxx@gmail.com. When e-mails are sent to user xxx@mail.muni.cz from eg mail-services.com, it may\n reject gmail.com's e-mails, because an email that appears to have been sent from mail-services.com actually came from mail.muni.cz.\nBecause the user has forwarded mail from IS MU.\n\nIf you have redirected letters from IS MU and the letters return to you as undeliverable,\n the solution is either to cancel the redirection of mail from IS MU or to change\n the addressee of the e-mail on the server mail-services.com to the destination xxx@gmail.com\n (and not to the forwarding mail xxx@mail.muni.cz).\n\nTip: Technical specificationThe sender's server administrator can set up from which computers his e-mails can be sent.\n Therefore, the sender's server administrator can solve the IS MU forwarding problem by entering the IS MU address\n into the list of computers from which it sends e-mails.

You can create folders, add files, download/read files, delete files and folders, change access rights, etc. Only the owner of the File Depository (and the owner of the explicit right g_depository) has the right to do these operations. By setting the access rights appropriately, you can allow other people to read files (either the is.muni.cz user or anyone on the Internet). However, people other than the owner are not allowed to view the contents of the File Depository, but if you want to provide a file to someone without an IS MU account, you must send them an internal link to the file (and give them the right to read it), see below. \n\t  \n\n\nA view of the File Depository itself:\n1  link to the File Depository from the menu in the Files section,\n2 files that you upload here yourself,\n3 files that are uploaded by another user (they are sorted into folders according to the user's učo and name),\n4 File Depository settings.\n\n\n\nOnly the owner can view his/her File Depository.

The violation of any of the rules may consequently lead to penalties and a serious violation even to being expelled from the University.\n\n  You should refrain from posting the messages promoting racial, , religious and political discrimination, making confidential information (this concerns, for instance, students' grades) and illegally obtained material public (also applies to that which you are not authorized to distribute), using vulgar expression and those violating basic principles of decency. The users will be held fully liable for any damage caused by someone else using their user name and password. Moreover, it is every IS user's duty to select the password that is hard to guess and do his/her best to protect it from any possible misuse.\n      \n      The Noticeboard is used for posting messages intended for academic community.

However, it is forbidden to insert messages into other sections separately.\n\nFor seminar group exchange requests, use the Seminar Group Exchange (for more see Help).\n\n\nAdvertisements (incl. Copies – crossposting) may only be inserted into the Classifieds section.\nGeneral invitations having the same meaning for all faculties belong only to the Invitations section.\n\nIt is forbidden to overuse the Noticeboard by duplicating the same or similar messages (spam).\n\nTipUsers with access rights vyveska_zpravy can insert similar messages in justified cases.\n\n      Crossposting: when inserting a message, it is allowed to check more sections where the message should be displayed to readers.

The person who starts a thread is the owner.  of the thread. The owner clearly defines the topic of discussion in the thread title. In Discussion Forums you are obliged to stick to the topic (so called being on-topic). It is forbidden to make posts with little informational value (called chatting). \n\n      \n      The thread owner may delete posts,  that violate the rules described here.

A post cannot be deleted by the author if it has already been responded to (but can be edited). Posts may be deleted by the thread founder. Authors are automatically notified by email when posts are deleted. \n\n          \n      Use the course-related discussion forums for posts on specific courses of study. It is not the responsibility of students, faculty, or school officials to read or respond to posts here. \n            \nRules for using the Discussion Forums\nform and content of the post\nDo not violate the laws of the Czech Republic, including the Copyright Act (Act No. 121/2000 Coll., on Copyright, on Rights Related to Copyright and on Amendments to Certain Acts, as amended; hereinafter referred to as the \"Copyright Act\"). Contribute primarily in Czech (Slovak). Write in English only if there is a reason (e.g. you are inserting a copy of the English text). If you post in another language for a compelling reason, include a brief translation into Czech (exception – conversational foreign language threads in course-related discussion forums). \n\n\nDo not post challenges, invitations or advertisements in the discussion forum, that is what the Noticeboard is for. \n\nDo not use CAPITAL LETTERS, it gives the impression that you are shouting. Don't be vulgar.\n\nconcise title/subject of the post\nIt is very important to give a concise title, so that it describes what the post is about and others can better navigate. Do not use headings like \"Help\", \"Question\", \"Problem\", \"Advise\".\n\ncopying posts\nDo not copy posts from another thread, system or private mail unless you are sure the author agrees. It is appropriate to explain the context of the original post.\n\nrepeating a post in multiple threads – crossposting\nDon't post in multiple threads at the same time, save others time.\n\nposts with little informational value\nFormulating a simple agreement, disagreement, amusement, etc. with a post containing a mere abbreviation (e.g. comma, hash, LOL, smiley face) is prohibited. Express this via a positive or negative rating of the post.\n\nchat posts and threads, chatting\nFor chat posts and threads, there are off-topic discussion forums. Please respect the readers who don't have time to read the chat threads.\n\ndiscussion topic – on topic/off topic, fair use\nStay on topic. Don't bother others. If you are reprimanded, comply. Do not address any disputes with the thread owner directly in the thread. \n\n\nDon't post an unrelated comment, or various P.S. If someone responds to an unrelated comment, they will start an off topic subthread.\n\nthread moderation\nTry to keep the level of discussion as high as possible. Do not limit the plurality of opinions. Penalize (by reprimanding and deleting posts) diversions from the topic. Penalize violations of the rules. Answer questions from contributors when you can. Even a chat thread can be monothematic –  use examples to inform contributors of the level of off-topic and information ballast that is acceptable to you. The thread is your calling card, take care of it so people like to visit it. \n\nThe moderator of the discussion forum has the duty to prevent any possible damage to the reputation of the school by the content or manner of communication in the forum.\n\n\nrights of system administrators\nThe administrators of the system reserve the right to make any interventions and changes aimed at better fulfilling the mission of the Information System - ensuring quality communication on university. The administrators will delete posts (including any responses to them) that do not comply with the rules.

        "answer": "Evaluace praxe je aplikace v Informačním systému  MU, která umožňuje komplexně zhodnotit a reflektovat realizaci učitelské praxe studenta. \nObsahuje sebehodnoticí nástroj, který propojuje hodnocení praxe studentem,  provázejícím učitelem \n a  oborovým didaktikem.\n Provázející učitelé typicky nemají přístup do Informačního systému. Komunikace s nimi proto probíhá přes zadaný e-mailový kontakt od studenta.\nAplikace Evaluace praxe umožňuje dva režimy sběru zpětné vazby: jednofázový a dvoufázový. V případě jednofázového režimu se Evaluace skládá ze tří odpovědníků.\n Jeden odpovědník vyplňuje student, druhý  provázející učitel  a třetí  oborový didaktik. Po odevzdání všech tří odpovědníků jsou odpovědníky sloučeny do jednoho výsledného odpovědníku, který si student zobrazí a získá tak zpětnou vazbu na svoji praxi. Do dvoufázového režimu Evaluace je přidán druhý odpovědník pro studenta, který student vyplňuje před praxí. Aplikace se tak skládá ze čtyř odpovědníků a výsledného sloučeného průchodu.\nAplikace je k dispozici přes:\nInformační systém  Učitel  (předmět praxe)  Praxe  Evaluace: studenti a odpovědi\n\n1 Ukázka Evaluace praxe vybraného studenta.",

Jako\nučitel můžete například:\n\nvystavit záložky k určitému tématu,\noznačit je štítkem a např. v textu\nstudijního materiálu na ně upozornit - jsou na adrese\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/zkratka_fakulty:kod_predmetu+jmeno_stitku\n\ntj. např.\n\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005!+web\n\nVariantu bez vykřičníku použijete, pokud chcete vyhledat i ty\nzáložky, které k předmětu nevložili učitelé, ale lib. uživatelé:\n\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005+web\n\nvystavit seznam doporučené literatury, jejíž položky jsou dostupné\non-line (články, volně šířené publikace). Pokud zadáváte studentům\nnapř. každý týden čtení, lze toto snadno vyznačit štítky, např.\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005!+cteni+prvni_tyden\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005!+cteni+druhy_tyden\nhttps://is.muni.cz/auth/ln/tag/FI:PV005!+cteni+nepovinne\nSnadnou editací štítků můžete seznamy pohodlně měnit, doplňovat. Může\nto být pohodlnější, než udržovat seznamy odkazů např. v souborech ve Wordu.\nStudentům jen sdělíte zvolenou konvenci (např. že mají hledat\n„cteni+prvni_tyden“) nebo jim v Interaktivní osnově či jinde připravíte\nodkaz se seznamem pro daný týden;\n\nzadat studentům vyhledat/aktualizovat záložky k určitému\ntématu a strukturovaně je oštítkovat a popsat (vyjádřit, co obsahují,\nproč by na ně čtenář měl klikat, jak jim připadají kvalitní, ...).\nPokud vaši studenti zpracovávají např. referáty k danému tématu, může\nbýt součástí úkolu průzkum a doplnění „Dalšího čtení k tématu“\nprostřednictvím této agendy;\n\nvyzvat studenty, aby si zkopírovali a okomentovali záložku -\nvložte odkaz např. na určitý článek. Pomocí „přidat k mým“ si student\nsnadno odkaz zkopíruje a může u něj vyplnit štítky a popis. Pod odkazem\nnapř. „14 osob“ se pak zobrazuje souborná stránka, kde lze popisy\nzhlédnout. \nNěkdy se v těchto systémech kromě sběru komentářů sbírá také „agregovaný\nnázor“ studentů: v popisu k vloženému článku formulujte dotaz, např. \n„Myslíte si, že autor Platónovo východisko správně pochopil? Vyjádřete\nsvůj názor štítkem ano / ne“ a přidejte k záložce štítky „ano“ a „ne“.\nStudent pak může použít volbu „rychle“, umazat štítek, pro který „nehlasuje“\na záložku si uložit. Cizí štítky jsou u záložky vypsány v pořadí\ndle četnosti použití, tj. je vidět, zda studenti hlasují spíše „ano“\nnebo „ne“. Můžete samozřejmě nechat „hlasovat“ i z více možností, např.\npomocí počtů hvězdiček ap.\n",

The evaluator can choose which indicators he wants to use, or add his own indicators. The weight with which it should be included in the overall evaluation of the employee can be set for each indicator.\n  Evaluation employees fill in the required data in the application.\n  Employees are notified of the start of evaluation period collection (by automated email or other means) and are required to complete and check individual indicators.  Some indicators (for example, the number of hours taught) are automatically calculated by the application, others must be added manually by an employee who is evaluated.  The employee has the option to add a comment to all indicators. If the automatically calculated value does not correspond to reality, the employee can enter his own value and explain in the comment where the difference occurred.\n  The evaluator adds his comments to the indicators.\n  As soon as the employee opens his evaluation, his evaluator can also look at the form, he has space for his comments for each indicator.\n  Based on the collected data, an evaluation interview is conducted between the evaluator and the evaluated employee.\n  For the interview, the documents collected in EVAK can be printed in PDF format.\n  The conclusions of the evaluation interview are recorded in the written evaluation record.\n  After completing all the information, the evaluator will finally close the evaluation record. From that moment on, it is no longer possible to edit it.\n  The evaluated employee approves the final evaluation record.\n  Depending on the setting of the given period, they do so either electronically (the evaluation record is then automatically stored in the employee's electronic file in the file service) or by signing a printed protocol with their own hand (it is then stored in the employee's physical personal file in the relevant personnel department).

The exception is the periods for workplace evaluation with non-academic staff. No indicator is automatically assigned to such periods, and the evaluator must choose all indicators himself.\nWhen editing indicators, EVAK automatically offers a list of all indicators introduced in the application. For easier manipulation, the list can be filtered by checking one or more limiting criteria. Then only those indicators that match at least one ticked label will be displayed. If the user does not find an indicator that meets his requirements among the established indicators, he can add his own indicator using the \"Create your own indicator\" field at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n1 A comment can be added to each indicator.\n\nFor all indicators for which the value is generated automatically by the IS (for example, the indicator \"Number of subjects including a worker\"), employees can also enter their own value if they do not agree with the automatically generated one.

        "title": "Can the indicators in EVAK be weighted?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can. The weights for the indicators can only be set before the start of the period. A typical procedure is as follows:\nThe employee establishes the employee evaluation period,\nassigns a list of indicators to the given period,\nthen assigns weights to the assigned indicators.\n\nThe weight assigns a higher importance to the selected indicators for auxiliary point evaluation of the performance of employees. Individual employees do not have access to the auxiliary point evaluation, and it is not reflected in their final evaluation report. It is therefore information intended only for the evaluator.\nWeights are set for a period that already has a list of indicators assigned, via the function:\nThe Information system  Managerial data   (EVAK)  EVAK - Vytvoření/úprava etapy hodnocení pracovníků  Načíst nebo zkopírovat existující etapu \nEditovat (vybranou etapu)  (Další aplikace)  Stanovení vah indikátorů\nThe application offers several pre-set indicator weights (taking into account the number of hours, taking into account the job position, taking into account a non-zero value of the indicator, etc.). By choosing them, the value of the coefficient is prefilled, according to which the point result of the indicator is recalculated. For example, the H/U coefficient is used for the weight \"zohlednění úvazku\", where H is the value of the indicator calculated by IS MU and U is the length of the tenure. The user can further modify this coefficient or create his own, completely new coefficient.\nThe evaluator is shown a clear table for each indicator, where he can see the current achieved values and the point results derived from them. If you enter a new coefficient for recalculating points, you must first click on the \"přepočítat\" button at the bottom of the page to view the new point results.\nIn addition to the value of the indicator and the point result of the employee, the table also shows information about the amount of work and job position (A – assistant, D – associate professor, L – lecturer, O – assistant professor, P – professor, V – researcher). Details about the calculated values of the indicator for a given employee can be displayed using the „rozepsat“ button.\nIf the evaluator does not add any weights to the indicators, the point results are the same as the calculated values.\n\n\n1 Indicator weight formula.\n2 The same value will have a different point result.\n",

        "answer": "As an evaluator, a person who is assigned the right e_evak in IS to the workplace where the evaluation stage is assigned can work with the EVAK application. The evaluator can also be set directly for the stage, in which case, if he does not have the e_evak right at the same time, he only has the \"EVAK - Sběr údajů pro hodnocení pracovníků\" application available and therefore cannot change the stage settings.\nThe role of the evaluator does not follow from the job title itself. If, on the other hand, it is necessary to allow the creation and modification of stages by a person who is not supposed to be an evaluator and who is not supposed to have access to the worker evaluation itself, the  e_evak_nastaveni  right can be assigned.",

        "answer": "In the event that the faculty or economic center creates several periods for evaluation, we recommend appropriate naming of both the periods themselves and possibly also the lists of indicators.\nYou can also assign labels to the periods and thus create your own system in them. Labels can be used in the export of period data and especially when filtering periods in data collection. Labels are displayed only to people with  the e_evak or e_evak right.\n\n\n1 Labels allow you to create your own period sorting system.\n\nIf the workplace is just starting with the evaluation, it may be appropriate to check the automatically calculated data before creating the stage via the IS MU. Use application for the evaluation of academic staff. It is thus easy to verify whether the system has sufficient data for the correct calculation of indicator values.\nTo check the stage before starting the evaluation, a copy of it can be created, where the evaluator or the faculty coordinator is set as the employee being evaluated. Similarly, a created list of indicators can be set to the test period. This procedure can be used to check the order of the indicators and their inclusion in the correct section, the setting of custom value insertion or whether the optional comments on the indicators are displayed correctly.\nThe created test stage can be started at any time before the start of sharp data collection, it can be modified continuously, but only until the moment when the employee evaluation is started (ie until the date entered in the \"Evaluation starts from\" field). Only those periods that have not yet started data collection can be edited completely. These periods can also be deleted without any problem, or the user support of IS MU can also delete an unnecessary stage.",

        "answer": "The hunting for places in queue agenda allows you to determine the order of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpeople who register for a given event - called a time contest. A time\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition can be a competition for theatre tickets, registration for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlucrative course, or limiting any offer in the Shopping Centre. Those\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinterested in a given event are selected only on the basis of the time registration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprinciple without any other criteria.

However,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe agenda of time competitions, built on the simple principle of a click\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition, allows the system to serve hundreds, thousands or even tens of\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthousands of applicants in a very short interval.",

        "answer": "The time contest agenda introduces electronic registration for the contest in three phases: \n\t\t\t\t\tPhase 1: obtaining the competition code\nIn the first phase, the entrant receives a ten-character random code free of charge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tat https://souteze.is.muni.cz/, which\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdetermines their ranking in the competition. This is the stage where the competition\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\titself takes place, depending on when the code was generated.\nEach code has a time stamp recorded on it, to 6 decimal places of a second,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcorresponding to the moment the user clicks on the button to obtain the code.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis time stamp is therefore used to determine the order. The application will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot allow any code to be generated for a given contest until the contest has\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstarted.\nPhase 2: registration of the competition code\nIn the second phase, the contest code obtained must be registered at \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://is.muni.cz/auth/souteze/registrace.pl.\nBy registering, the user both confirms his/her interest in participating in the \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcompetition and also finds out whether his/her code is successful. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA successful code is one whose ranking is lower than the set capacity of the event. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegistration for the competition takes place on an individual basis over a 24-hour period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTherefore, it does not matter when the contestant confirms the registration within the set 24 hours.\nAn unsuccessful contestant has the option to return to the application within the validity \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinterval of their code, re-enter the code and test whether the ranking has changed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the event of a vacancy, the code holder will be notified by email. However, the system \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill only send an email for the first code released in this way.\nPhase 3: processing of the competition code\nAfter a successful registration phase, the participant is \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tentitled to to collect the prize in a timed competition typically 14 days. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuring this period, for example, he/she must pick up tickets or pay for the service in \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tquestion at the Shopping Centre. When making a purchase, the participant presents the competition code.\nIf the competition code is not used within the time limit, the code becomes invalid \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the capacity becomes available for other entrants, who are automatically notified \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby email and thus become eligible to register again under Phase 2.\nThe competition ends when all codes meeting capacity have been processed or the competition \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tend date has been entered. Available capacity is offered on a rolling basis according to interest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf there is sufficient capacity, codes generated several days after the start of the competition may \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\talso be eligible.

(Note: If the EO is creating a completely\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnew order, it is possible to set the sale to the next day at the earliest due to data transfer between systems.)\nThe IS-technician is obliged to enter the following data into the SC:\naccounting analytics\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprice\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe name of the package (which will be displayed to customers both when shopping and on the invoice), the dates of the event and the sale (from-to)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpacking capacity\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpayment method (options described below)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription of the offered product\nOptionally, other sales settings can be used:\nsales restrictions\nto a specific group of customers (e.g. only employees, students of a certain field, forms, etc.)\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontract\na contract can be attached to the package, but this may need to be prepared in advance; \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta universal contract for the provision of educational services is available\n\t\t\t\t\t\tother specific settings\ne.g. forcing the purchaser to fill in a note, limiting the capacity to one per user \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(excluding repeat purchases), limiting the order to only those users who have ordered \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tanother package in the past, sending an information email to the selected person \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timmediately after any purchase of a package, or crediting payment to the order, etc.\nWe recommend contacting the IS-technician well in advance of the planned start of sales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tEspecially if it is a new, previously unsold offer, it can be time-consuming to set up. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can also expect a longer lead time if the upcoming sale has many variations (typically \n\t\t\t\t\t\ta whole set of packages including early bird fees, last minute fees, student fees, etc.) \n\t\t\t\t\t\tor has a specific setup (e.g. related to course packages).",

The first option is \"Two-factor account verification\", which will allow you to protect your account in the IS with both a password and the national identification portal identitaobcana.cz.\nIt will then not be enough to simply enter the password to log in to the system, but it will always be necessary to prove your identity via the mentioned portal (using a chip card, e-citizen, e-government mobile key or via the My ID application). This feature will make it significantly more difficult for attackers to try to solicit their passwords from users in various ways (via phishing, etc.), because it will take two steps instead of one to log in to the system.\nThe second option is the setting „Other primary password for other systems“,which will prevent the primary password from being taken over for other systems in addition to the  IS MU itself. This option gives users a tool to take more control of their passwords. The „Primary password to the MU“ will then be used only for logging in to the IS MU and will not be passed on. The \"other primary password\" will be used in the so-called single login at MU for example to log in to an e-attendance, the SUPO dormitory payment system or to pre-order lunch in the canteen.\nBoth options can be set in the section:\nThe Information system  System  Change password\n\n\n1 Vyšší stupeň zabezpečení IS MU.\n",

Missing diacritics in words\n      will be added automatically and in addition, the results will display all possible inflections of the search term (an inflection is a modification of word forms expressing grammatical categories, such as gender,\n      number, case, tense, or person; flexible words also use declension and conjugation ).\n      \nExample: If you enter Jarni semestr, the search results will also include the term V semestru jarním.\n      exact term\nIf you enter an term in double quotation marks - \"psychologické experimenty\" - the results will include only the exact term, while the documents containing\n      inflected forms of the term or diacritics will be ignored.\n      \n      Note: Even if you do not use quotation marks, the preferred search results are those with the search terms in close proximity.\nExample: If you search for the string \"icq2go\", the results are thedocuments containing the words \"icq\", \"2\", and \"go\" in a sequence and without\n      inflection or adding diacritics.\nExample: If you search for the string \"karel čapek\", the search results are the documents containing this exact term, but not other terms, such as\n     \"karla čapka\". Quotation marks not properly closed are considered to be punctuation marks.       \nterm without a word\nIf you enter a term with a minus sign, e.g. experimenty -psychologické, the search results will exclude documents\n      containing the word immediately following the minus sign. Do not inflect the word and do not\n      add diacritics. The minus sign must be preceded by a space or it must appear at the beginning of the term; however, the minus sign must not be followed by a space.\n\n      \nCaution! A minus sign within a word (used as a hyphen, such as e-learning or Frýdek-Místek) functions as a search for the exact term which also includes\n      diacritics and inflection in the search results.\n    \n\t string with the '+' prefix\nIf you add a plus sign in front of the term so that there is no space separating them, the search results will include only documents with the exact term; in other words,\n      variations in inflection or diacritics will be ignored.\n      \nExample: If you search for the term +ježka, the search results will include documents with the term \"ježka\", but not \"ježek\",\n      \"ježkem\", \"jezek\" etc.\n     punctuation\nA punctuation mark divides the search term into individual words. If the search string is a term without spaces and with one or more\n      punctuation marks, the search results will include documents which contain all the words of the search string in succession. Word forms created by\n      inflection or adding diacritics will also be included in the search results.\n      \nExample: If you use the string věda-výzkum, the search results will include documents containing the forms of the word \"věda\" which are immediately\n      followed by the forms of the word \"výzkum\", e.g. \"oddělení pro vědu, výzkum a vnější vztahy\".\n      \nlimiting results to a specific section\nIf the search term yields too many results, try limiting the search\n      to a specific section.

        "answer": "The user may use the MU Information System (MU IS) in accordance with its academic, educational and research mission and primarily for the administrative and operational purposes of the school.\n  \n  The use of the MU IS for commercial activities unrelated to the school's activities, political, religious or racial agitation is considered a violation of the rules.\n  The user works in the MU IS only under the user name assigned to him/her.\n  He/She chooses a non-trivial password for his/hers username so that it cannot be guessed. The user must not disclose the password to any other person, not even to the system administrator. The user must handle the password in such a way that it cannot be compromised. The password must not be sent by e-mail, as this is an inherently insecure service (it can be intercepted, it can be delivered by mistake to another recipient, etc.).\n  If a user accesses an absent user's session (e.g. by using a computer on which another user has started work but has not finished it so that new access to the MU IS requires password re-execution), the user must terminate the session without delay. \n  \n  The user is forbidden to take any action aimed at establishing a password other than his/her own. It is also forbidden to impersonate another or anonymous user or to falsify one's own identity in any way. \n  \n  Providing your account to a user who is not entitled to an account in the MU IS or whose account has been blocked is considered a particularly serious breach of the rules.\n  Administrative agendas and files in the mail processing process are the private data of their owners and are entitled to the same privacy protections as other types of personally owned documents. Violations of this rule are considered particularly egregious. \n  \n  Staff members are responsible for personal data within the scope of the general legal standards (in particular 256/92 Coll.).\n  The user must not burden the IS with bulk operations. If the user is found to be overloading the system with operations that are more frequent than the usual load generated by manual clicking, the user may be automatically blocked from accessing the IS for a limited period of time. The use of bulk operations is subject to the prior approval of the IS operators, who can be contacted at the e-mail address below.\n  The network administrator, or computer administrator, has the right to perform all operations necessary to perform his or her function, including checking the content of files, monitoring user activity, etc. However, the information obtained in this way is strictly confidential.\n  The user has the right to use only the software whose license allows the user directly or the school in general to do so. This includes software obtained in accordance with the law, including copyright. Copying of software and data (including audio, video files and graphics) is only permitted in accordance with the applicable licence conditions.\n  A mailbox is primarily set up for users to ensure easy communication with the school. The user must not compromise the reliability and trustworthiness of mail delivery to his/her mailbox (e.g., by redirecting mail to unreliable machines, such as machines without adequate security or without permanent mail processing). \nIn the event that problems with mail delivery caused by the recipient of a letter are detected, the administrator is obliged to immediately remedy the situation (cancel the redirection) and notify the recipient of the situation. \nIn case of recurrence of problems caused by the recipient, the administrator is entitled to block the recipient's accounts.\n  The administrators are not liable for any loss of data arising in any way. However, this does not relieve them of the obligation to regularly back up the contents of the disks of the main MU IS  server.\n  It is forbidden to send unsolicited letters to a large number of e-mail addresses. In case of violation of the rule, the user will be automatically blocked from accessing the mail for 12 hours. It is forbidden to send chain, pyramid, etc. letters.\n  The use of vulgar and highly emotive language is prohibited in open communication. The user bears full responsibility for any defective content of his/her own letters or other publicly available information sources.\n  All actions aimed at reducing safety or leading to possible violations of operating rules, both conscious and unconscious, are unacceptable. It is forbidden to distribute viruses, worms, glitches, Trojan horses, corrupted files, fake messages and other elements of a destructive or fraudulent nature.\n  The user is obliged to follow and unconditionally comply with all operating instructions of the administrators (they are communicated electronically).
